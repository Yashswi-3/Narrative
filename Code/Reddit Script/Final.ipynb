      "   - If you want them directly against the wall or maybe a few centimeters away, the only requirement is that they're not rear ported, as that would require merely a few inches, but not less.  Beyond that port spacing requirement, all speakers work best as as close to the wall as possible, but simply need EQ to tailor the bass response.  So buy whatever speakers you want based on the other factors you value or strengths they have, but you must implement a way of using parametric EQ, either from a PC, or miniDSP, or a source that has custom EQ ability or competent room correction.\n",
      "   - You should look for front or downward ported speakers.   But even with these it would help to be at least 8\" away.  But if you can't, you can always place cheap acoustic panels behind the speakers to prevent harsh reflections from being so close.  I did this with my Elac UBR 62s that were to close to the back and side walls in my bedroom office and it really cut down on the harsh treble.   They work because they have an NRC of 95% (but only work on upper mids and treble).  Here's a picture of them\n",

      "   - Far too many questions, and your level of ignorance is so extreme that it would not be easy to answer them because of the sheer amount of background or foundational knowledge that would have to be expressed; you need an entire book it seems.\n",
      "\n",
      "How about instead you don't worry about ANY of that.  You're describing one of the simplest setups there is.  You could do this with one HDMI cable or optical cable from the TV to your system.  This isn't the way I would do it but you can.  This assumes you're using the TV for a PC monitor.  If you're not, then you'll need 2 connections.  Just use the optical output from the PC, and the HDMI from the TV in that case.  Yes you could also use the GPU HDMI out, if you have enough HDMI inputs.  The reason HDMI can transmit audio is because it's just digital, your old soundcard had a DAC, turning that into an analog signal.\n",
      "\n",
      "You only need one thing, and I recommend this due to its simplicity and relatively high audio quality, but it's not the cheapest solution possible.  Get the Klipsch \"Sevens\" or \"Nines\", not the Fives they're too small and lame, but if you can swing one of the two bigger models, it'll be great and super simple for you.  Really any powered speakers with multiple inputs and a remote will work.\n",
      "   - If you want good quality surround sound from your PC, get an AVR and passive speakers. Your PC connects to the AVR using an HDMI cable. Then, the AVR to the TV with another HDMI cable.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of my PC's have passive speakers powered by AVRs. I have a 5.1 system hooked to my HTPC, a 2.1 system on my main machine, and a 3.0/5.0 system in the bedroom.\n",

      "Along with getting the speakers, AVR, and cables, there's also some software setting you have to configure. It's not to hard to do.\n",
