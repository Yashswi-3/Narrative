I use Arq for file backup and they provide a configuration to use an existing Amazon S3 bucket I pay for which is super convenient. Why can’t I pay for an API key so all requests I make go through it and then I pay monthly for usage? Hell I’ll pay Reddit a fee just to be granted an API key to enable this. This is simply hostile by Reddit and runs in contradiction with their goals to make money from developer API access.\n\n2) Christian is on the hook for QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS to pay back Apollo annual subscribers and there’s likely not a way to quickly build a toggle for users to opt in and say “no way, keep the money” because the timeframe is too short. Again, not only is Christian losing his main source of income but also is out of pocket $250,000 due to shitty actions by Reddit.\n\nPersonally I want to see Reddit slapped with a monster lawsuit because Christian is right: their lies will impact his career going forward and have tarnished his reputation. \n\nFuck Reddit and fuck Spez",

Pretty crazy how he seems to be getting away with what should be career-ending statements.\n\nIt's just such a shame that they couldn't make a bit of effort to negotiate reasonable pricing- I would have been happy paying a small subscription. If that's their attitude to potential paying customers (ie you and other developers), I don't know how the hell they expect to come across as an investable company with a solid business model.\n\nHave tipped a small amount, as Apollo had probably been the most used app on my phone for a while now.\n\nBest wishes for whatever you do next!",

So, a few days later, I eat the rest. again, damn near nothing happens.  As it turns out, I just can't get high off marshmallow based edibles for some reason. They just don't work very well on me. But I didn't know this then.\n\nShe sends me a 220mg chocolate bar a few weeks after that. I remember thinking that well, if roughly 50mg did almost nothing (I felt a tiny itsy bitsy bit of high) then I should eat the entire chocolate bar and maybe I'd get a decent high.\n\nOh my, was that a mistake.\n\nAs it turns out, chocolate based edibles are extra effective on me. Even now, when I have years of experience with edibles and decades of experience smoking weed (I started in 1992), 50mg of THC chocolate is usually too much for me. I'd just eaten 220mg. I remember saying at one point, \"I can actually feel myself getting higher every second. It's like I'm riding a weed elevator.\" After about an two hours, I'm losing my shit and then I realize something. My kitchen is messy and the police are definitely on their way to arrest me for letting my kitchen get so messy. So I started freaking out and panic cleaning my kitchen. It's also 2am. So, imagine an insanely high person desperately cleaning his kitchen at 2am, positive the cops are about to break his door down any second and arrest him.\n\nI eventually realize I have to work the next day and I really need to sleep. My shift started at 9am and it's already 2am. I slept for like 5-6 hours and actually woke up feeling completely fine. I don't remember the day at work at all, so I assume it was uneventful.",
