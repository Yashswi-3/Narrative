            "So, if you can get a Lenovo Legion Slim with RTX 4060 it will be much better than any other RTX 4050 laptop. Now, if you care about memory you can look at laptop's storage slots available, if it has 2x then you can buy another m2 ssd and add 1-2TB of storage to the laptop pretty easily, same for ram. \nYou can check deals available for your region here: https://gaminglaptop.deals/\nNow, if you live in USA, you could go to Microcenter and see if there's any deals on open-box new laptops, you could get something REALLY good for much cheaper.",

            "Hey there. I would suggest to avoid the Intel version of the LOQ, if possible. There have been way too many dead motherboard issues on that Lenovo model specifically for all the Intel processor variants, just some friendly info! \n\nIf budget is not a problem, an Nvidia graphics card (the higher the better) would be great, and the lenovo legion variants are always top notch. \n\nI personally prefer Ryzen processors because of their power and heat efficiency, as well as because the latest Intel chips seem a little unstable, but that is more of personal taste than anything else."

If you do find a good quality laptop, would you mind telling me? It's just that I've been looking, but I have no knowledge of these things at all.",
            "Hey my friend, i don't like Acer so much because of their cooling system. Generally Acer is not giving a lot of attention for build quality. This is my opinion, Furthermore, i'm using the last months a well known brand here in Europe, [Dream Machines](https://dreammachines.io/en/laptops), that they are offering their products via Newegg also. Maybe is worth to check it.",
            "The laptop you chose seems really good but you don't need to spend $1500 on a laptop. These days, you can get a good laptop for under $500 if you are not doing any super hardcore gaming requiring 100s of GB memory and the highest level of graphics. Some basic things to look for are an SSD, at least 8 GB of ram, and at least 2.0 Ghz clockspeed. These are like the bare minimum when looking for a good laptop."
