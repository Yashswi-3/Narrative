For instance, according to the Talmud, the Roman emperor Antoninus Pius was switched as a baby with Rabbi Yehuda Hanasi. Because of this he became friends with him later in life and was good to the Jews. In reality Antoninus wasn't that good to the Jews, but compared to his predecessor Hadrian, he must have seemed like an angel\n",

This was mostly due to local land holders who saw no reason to be part of a Roman state that could not protect them. The waves of invaders that occupied more land and took more bites out of the Roman economic pie led to a nasty feedback loop. Attila in the 440‚Äôs was devastating to the empire. Even worse was the crushing loss of Africa which supplied grain to Italy, supporting Rome‚Äôs large population. It had less to do with corruption or morality and more to do with simply being unable to deal with such a large number of invaders with constantly dwindling resources. Lack of good emperors and generals due to so many reasons adds to this. \n",
