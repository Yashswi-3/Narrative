Application of damnatio ad bestias to Christians was intended to equate them with the worst criminals, who were usually punished this way.\n",

      ">Lions were rare in Ancient Rome and human sacrifice was banned there by Numa Pompilius in the 7th century BC, according to legend. Damnatio ad bestias appeared there not as a spiritual practice but rather a spectacle. In addition to lions, other animals were used for this purpose, including dogs, wolves, bears, leopards, tigers, hyenas, and crocodiles. It was combined with gladiatorial combat and was first featured at the Roman Forum and then transferred to the amphitheaters.\n",

      "   - Like a year ago I wrote a paper on the fall of the western Roman Empire. What I remember from studying is that it didn’t actually collapse, just transitioned into new states. This was mostly due to local land holders who saw no reason to be part of a Roman state that could not protect them. The waves of invaders that occupied more land and took more bites out of the Roman economic pie led to a nasty feedback loop. Attila in the 440’s was devastating to the empire. Even worse was the crushing loss of Africa which supplied grain to Italy, supporting Rome’s large population. It had less to do with corruption or morality and more to do with simply being unable to deal with such a large number of invaders with constantly dwindling resources. Lack of good emperors and generals due to so many reasons adds to this. \n",
