      "   - If you want them directly against the wall or maybe a few centimeters away, the only requirement is that they're not rear ported, as that would require merely a few inches, but not less.  Beyond that port spacing requirement, all speakers work best as as close to the wall as possible, but simply need EQ to tailor the bass response.  So buy whatever speakers you want based on the other factors you value or strengths they have, but you must implement a way of using parametric EQ, either from a PC, or miniDSP, or a source that has custom EQ ability or competent room correction.\n",
      "   - You should look for front or downward ported speakers.   But even with these it would help to be at least 8\" away.  But if you can't, you can always place cheap acoustic panels behind the speakers to prevent harsh reflections from being so close.  I did this with my Elac UBR 62s that were to close to the back and side walls in my bedroom office and it really cut down on the harsh treble.   They work because they have an NRC of 95% (but only work on upper mids and treble).  Here's a picture of them\n",

      "How about instead you don't worry about ANY of that.  You're describing one of the simplest setups there is.  You could do this with one HDMI cable or optical cable from the TV to your system.  This isn't the way I would do it but you can.  This assumes you're using the TV for a PC monitor.  If you're not, then you'll need 2 connections.  Just use the optical output from the PC, and the HDMI from the TV in that case.  Yes you could also use the GPU HDMI out, if you have enough HDMI inputs.  The reason HDMI can transmit audio is because it's just digital, your old soundcard had a DAC, turning that into an analog signal.\n",
      "\n",
      "You only need one thing, and I recommend this due to its simplicity and relatively high audio quality, but it's not the cheapest solution possible.  Get the Klipsch \"Sevens\" or \"Nines\", not the Fives they're too small and lame, but if you can swing one of the two bigger models, it'll be great and super simple for you.  Really any powered speakers with multiple inputs and a remote will work.\n",

      "Feedback on the Leviathan v2 though: I ran the $200-300 model for about 6 months. When it worked, it sounded great. Not as good as a full 5 or 7.1 setup, but for its size it does a decent job. At the 6 month mark though, my audio dropped in the middle of a show I was watching. I spent the next hour or two trying to figure out why it seemed to be powered on but wouldn't connect to anything. Opened a case with Razer and they wouldn't even talk to me about troubleshooting without a copy of my receipt which I did not have. I argued with them for 2 weeks and finally just took it back to Best Buy where I bought it. Grabbed the Edifier r1700 and it sounds so much better than the Razer.\n",

      "   - Well currently the king of affordability and airflow is Cooler Master. There cases are typically more affordable while maintaining great airflow, achieving rave reviews. Most of them have great, large side panel fans for your GPUS.\n",
      "\n",
      "However the downside to Cooler Master is that the case itself is one ugly plastic SOB. Sorry to say. I'm speaking in terms of the HAF series which is their flagship case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Corsair is another highly rated case. They're the middle ground of affordability and airflow. I know that the Graphite series has great reviews, great looks, and is just an overall wonderful case. It has a side panel fan that is easily detachable for convenience and cooling. \n",
      "\n",
      "Antec is hardly recommended. I would say their only good series is anything 900+. The 300 is old and has poor cable management. About 6 months ago it was highly recommended off of sheer popularity. The 1200 series is a great case with great cable management, I can vouch that myself. In terms of price, it is again at the middle ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "I myself advocate for silent/performance/aesthetics. Fractal Design is my personal choice. It's affordable, extremely well built, durable (many hours in the car riding among horse poop), and just fricking gorgeous. There is sound dampening material that makes the case silent as well as anti-vibration installments of the HDD slots and stands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me tell you, I was skeptical about it not being cool, poor airflow with what appeared to be a restricted design. I was wrong. It is unbelievably cool. My CPU idles 23-26C, GPU idles around 29C. I have a Noctua, but before I did my stock fan had peaked 46-55C on max load (stock voltage/speed.) This beauty has great cable management in the back, quality painted interior, and side-panel fans for your needs. \n",
      "\n",
      "NZXT is another great alternative. There flagship case is the Phantom. It looks literally like a flagship. However, it does not have a side-panel fan. In terms of affordability, it's average. The Vulcan is a great affordable case with great airflow, not sure about 3xSLI support. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are other cases out there, but there not to great to recommend personally. Look at the reviews, key in to the design/aesthetics, and see if you're willing to spend that much.\n",
      "\n",
      "A good case for all that support will cost around $70-120. \n",

      "the [silverstone ft02](http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/SilverStone-Fortress-FT02-Case-Review/901/7) may be up your alley, though it has a 90-degree rotated motherboard design to help with cooling. 3 180mm fans blowing air through your gpu's/cpu = ICE COLD. if you're going to be spending that much on a case, you may as well go for the best. the tj07 is also great, if an aging design. \n",
      "\n",
      "if you want, you can also go for the coolermaster HAF X, though it doesn't hold a candle to the silverstone cases in terms of build quality. honestly though if you have that much money to blow i'd rather just get a corsair 800D or 650D and put in watercooling. \n",
      "   - Well, I have a Cooler Master Haf X, and I love it. It's huge, and awesome airflow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people say it's butt ugly, but I've grown fond of it. It's got the right looks for a battlestation, if I wanted a sleek and pretty design, I'd go Mac, haha.\n",
      "   - I'm gonna throw a lesser known brand out there but Azza makes some damned fine cases. I bought one on a whim for 70$'s and I love it. Azza Helios 910. Great airflow, nice looks, bottom mounted psu, easy to remove front panel covers, a 5.25\" to 3.5\" conversion piece, lots and lots of thumb screws, huge 200mm side fan. I'm running at 28 degrees on my motherboard sensor.\n",

      "   - For around $150, you should be able to nab yourself a Radeon HD 6850, or if you're lucky, a Radeon HD 6870 if one is on sale. Your PSU should be fine for your setup as long as it operates properly.\n",
      "   - For 100-150 you can get an hd6850 or possibly 6870 (there are a few that come to about 150 after rebate) if you want to go ATI.  The best current nvidia card you can find in that range is possibly a gtx 460 (possibly not the normal 1gb model, but maybe a 768mb or 1gb SE), there are a few right aroung 150 after rebate.  If you want to go cheaper and closer to 100 or under, the HD 5770/6770 is a great bang for the buck and still a decent low end gaming card.\n",
      "\n",
      "If it's a decent brand PSU, 480W should be fine for the cards in your budget.  I used one of the PSU calculators and put in your i3 and a 6870, and 6 fans, a cpu cooler, extra drives etc to give a bit of headroom and it came out to about 420W.  If you wanted a new psu, something like an antec NEO 520W should be plenty, or if you plan to upgrade further in the future you could go for a 600-650, which would be more than enough for anything you could possibly fit in that computer.\n",
      "   - Before you replace the PSU find out how good it actually is. Look at the base specs (most important: 12V lines, how many amps / watts can you pull from them?) and use a psu load calculator to find out how much you actually use. Only if that exceeds 90% of the 12V power (nearly all components nowadays use the 12V line) get a new PSU.\n",

He got to know my friend was christian, and they immediately wanted him to say Jai shri vishnu. And my friend did not have any issues so he did. They asked me to do it, i refused. They fought with me and tried to beat me up still i did not wanna say it. I slapped two of them hard in that process. Not because i dont believe in hindu gods, just because nobody can force me to believe or force me to give respect, validate their own beliefs. It is as simple as that.

A maid can at most work for 3-4 apartments due to work load. My friend offered Rs.5000 since she felt 2,500 was too low. The other professors confronted her saying she shouldn’t create unnecessary problems. She went back to paying 2500 and then gave the maid’s kids some cash for their studies on the side.\n",
