Take the help of NCH. And next time don't buy such things online prefer to buy from a trusted offline store. Speaking from personal experience",

The box reached the Amazon Fulfillment warehouse and was added back to the inventory and shipped again for the OP’s order. The warehouse employees sometimes skip visual verification before adding the customer returns back to good inventory. And the amazon return policy is quite ignorant towards customers doing such swaps.\n\nI remember a friend of mine used to work for myntra some years back and said more than 50% of rayban aviators returned by customers were swaps with fake Rs100 aviators. Myntra now instructs pickup executives to verify but not sure how those executives verify fakes\n\nOP did a wrong thing to not get an open box delivery.\n\nNow to shorten the pain, instead of complaining to Amazon and fighting it, you can just create a return or exchange, which they usually do without questions asked. Give it a try, you will get a correct new product in return. I have done it when I faced tthis issue but not for an expensive product like yours, so try and let me know how it went.",

And where is the image of the invoice?\n\nDodgy buyers can also routinely buy expensive packages, open them, replace the item and seal it as in your image, and then claim a refund or replacement while they can handily sell the original for a profit.

If Amazon refuses to cooperate, file a complaint on the National Consumer Helpline (https://consumerhelpline.gov.in) and consider going to your district consumer court.

When I opened the box, there was no stylus pen that was supposed come with the laptop itself. I called the customer care and they said that they'll conduct an internal investigation and will be give resolution om 29th January.\nSo yesterday they called and said that they can only provide return and not replace the laptop as it was not available. But I didn't want to replace the laptop as it was out of stock everywhere and I had immediate use of it. So they arrogantly said that nothing can be done. I even asked them to give deliver the stylus separately or give partial refund, I was even ready to accept it in amazon gift card. They still refused.\nAs the last option, I decided to file a complaint with consumer helpline but I don't think anything will happen. So I guess I'm stuck with it.",
            "Here are some tips for future shopping.\n\n1. Never ever buy anything valuable from a seller other than official sellers. Not even when other sellers have lower prices. \n2. Always go for the Prime verified products.\n3. Never ever accept a delivery of a valuable product if it doesn't come in a tamper proof package.\n4. If you have any doubt, always record a video of opening the package.\n\nI have been using Amazon almost exclusively for the last few years and this has never happened to me because I've followed these things. If an unknown seller was selling something at half the price, I'd much rather buy it at full price from an official seller. I'd rather have my peace of mind than save money.",
            "The problem is not Amazon alone. Its these middle men and the third party people who are employed.  A lot of electronics stuff is still kept at the local vendors and local warehouses, and there is an incentive for fraud. Also do keep in mind that larger packages have the bells of the warehouse and delivery staff ringing. I know this will sound bad, but to be real, theft like this happens all the time at the delivery guys levels as well. Its better to never order any gadget more than 1,500/- from Amazon or even the original company. For that matter, anything that can be sold outside. Its better to buy it from a physical seller. \n\nNow if you really want to see anything at all from Amazon, see which products have a full return (not replacement) on Amazon. If the company is denying return, or the seller is denying return (again, replacement doesn't count) chances are the product would be sub standard or there would be instances of scams.\n\nThis is one of the biggest pain points of outbound logistics. It happens in the US, it happens in every country, and it happens in India.",

The nightmarish possibilities are scary, those precious babies would become projectiles in an even relatively minor accident. People don't even use seatbelts, which, after I saw what road traffic looks like even outside major cities, I will never understand.\n\nMy husband sent me pics from a train trip to the mountains he took with friends as a \"last hurrah\" shortly before he came here to the US to be with me. Sweet mother of mercy! 🙀  they sat with their legs dangling out of the *open* train car!! At least I see in pictures that most major railroad crossings are guarded, but, train safety in general, as well seems to cause problems. \n\nIn another incident, he recounted going swimming in a nearby river following the monsoon rains. They jumped off this small bridge, which was making the water churn, making a strong undercurrent. One of his friends almost drowned. In the US, anybody caught swimming in a dangerous area would be given a citation by police, there would be signs posted, maybe some enclosure. IDK.\n\nAnd water/food safety. In the 3-4 years it took to get him here, he caught Typhoid *twice*, despite their home having an innovator (sp?) to clean the drinking water, plus they boil it for many purposes. \n\nThe US might go overboard in some ways, but, I'd rather have this than the careless, fatalistic attitude that seems to be a feature of the Indian culture writ large. India does lots of things *right*, and I would live there in half a heartbeat. (As long as it's my little dream home in the Himachal Himalaya.) A sense of community, a focus on family ties, people actually caring about each other.

I see guys who have objectified women without thinking twice and are posting stories of saving and respecting women. It’s hilarious and extremely sad at the same time. If somebody calls them out, these dumbasses wouldn’t be able to comprehend what’s wrong with them. So it is indeed to jump on the bandwagon and not feel left out.\n2. Even if the insta story is just shared out of FOMO, once you’re constantly shoved something in your face, you will read it atleast once, however unwilling you are, you will get educated and aware at the least.

I don’t believe it is possible to change the way women are treated with these older generations still being the majority. \n\nWhile social media has certainly helped bring some cases (like the Porsche Taycan manslaughter) which could’ve been easily cover up into light, it has started to portray even basic women’s rights as woke western left wing propaganda. Just look at the comments on an Instagram post with a woman that’s not a thirst trap. I can easily bet that 70 percent of the time all negative comments will be from Indian men. It is disgusting and all of these twats are fueling the already growing Xenophobia against Indians. There is still a long way to go but we will make the country a better place for all.",

            "I remember reading news articles when marital rape was about to be issued as a crime in law and people were like \"but sex is why we marry\" dude, sex is not he same as rape\n\nI also believe parents must teach their children, both boys and girls about their autonomy and to respect it as well as respect the body and wishes of others (not of it crosses over their's btw, more like, if a fried tell them \"I don't want you to touch my hair\" then no touching that person's hair), Moreover if you don't, someone can and will take advantage of that, no sugar coating please, treat your child like a future adult in these matters and be completely open and honest with them, you are their guardian, their pillar of trust and security, good touch bad touch is a start but is not enough, for either of them, they will get harmed and wonder why they feel disgusted and hurt by actions of adults, more over it happens with people who have gained trust of lonely, quite children the most (of course not a hard and fast rule, perfect victims dont exist but victims are all equally important)\n\nThere was a time when rape cases were in the flash news segment and you could see every 3rd case bing of rape\n\nMedia also sensationalises rape cases, barely treating them with respect that they deserve but also going out of their way to not cover equally heinous crimes that cannot be sensationalised (there were I believe 3 murder cases happening at the same time, one was about a girl getting murdered by her Muslim bf, the other was a man getting murdered by his wife and her lover, both equally horrible and the media chose to cover only one of them and treat it to create public outrage against a group, no prizes of you guess) this is a great act of disrespect to justice and the victims, using their horrific moments as a shovel to throw dirt, yuck!\n\nCourt cases can stretch on for years man! The victims get messed up because of how many times they have to attend to the next hearing, the rich criminals will run the case dry before walking out with a bail or forcing the victims to go back to being silent \n\nIdk where it comes from, perhaps a very twisted appearance of hoping that someone actually didn't get raped but all we as a society do is disrespect the victims! We don't take their cries seriously, we congratulate them, unironically (forget boys being boys, I have seen women who do this and I am a girl and all I could do was stare at her as she talked to me giggling as they talk about someone's experience)  make fun of these things happening to people around us as if they are gossip!\nJust making that point to show that scummy behaviour comes from anywhere and being too on guard with one side leaves us vulnerable to being back stabbed, there is no us Vs them but an us Vs us, awful people are awful\n\nWe get angry when something Albert Fish level happens and then we are back to normal, it's not a habit within us, but getting angry for a few days is and people like this Roy dude take advantage of that, look at his carefree attitude, he knows we will be back to normal after a week at most, 2 being generous\n\nWe also learn about how nutritional deficiency is common in teen girls, one reason being they are kept away from the nutrition they need, if a family has many kids with different sex they will prioritize males over females, girls skip school even today because periods, that is 7% of a month assuming it's on the lesser side\n\nWe as Indians need to change our attitudes and see our daughters the same way we look at Goddess Durga, although considering audacious creeps will harass young girls at Durga pandals, uh let's be real, there is no fear, hospitals and education institutes are seen equal to religious places and that never stopped criminals\n\nIf someone does do this crime the least we can hope is that they don't go and sleep in police barracks peacefully like this man!\nLike hearing he slept peacefully after the heinous things he did (the adductor canal of the thigh is super strong btw, 90° bends is oh my god what the hell) thyroid cartilage is not a flimsy little thing either and that is besides the glasses in eyeballs\n\nWe as humans should treat victims of crimes with respect, irrespective of gender, caste, appearance, etc",

            "(In paragraphs)\n\nRape culture in india \n\nposting a story on instagram won't make a difference. we need to change how we view women. Often, crimes against women get attention only after the victim is killed and only if society thinks she was \"respectable.\" Social media and the news might briefly focus on the crime, but it rarely leads to real change. People quickly call for harsh punishments like \"hang the rapists\" but this just becomes a hot topic for news and then disappears into thin air without any true action upon those rapists.\n\nAsk yourself: Are we truly making a difference, or are we merely engaging in performative activism? the reality is that posting on social media doesn't challenge the deeply rooted societal norms that allow such violence to persist.\n\nResearch shows that rape is not about arousal but about power and control. Some men feel a sense of superiority, viewing themselves as protectors and women as inferior, weak and pathetic beings. We need to introspect and understand that both men and women are equal. Nobody is superior. Think about how often we excuse inappropriate behavior towards women as \"boys being boys.\" How frequently do we ignore patriarchal comments or actions from our friends and not even hold them accountable for their actions? how often do we judge women based on their appearance rather than their abilities? how frequently do we disrespect a woman for having multiple partners or being sexually active?\n\nWe live in a society that objectifies women as sexual objects and normalizes rape within marriage as if it's just a part of marriage. We are the same society that sensationalizes a woman's (tripti) sensuality rather than her other movies. We applaud when a woman from a particular community is raped, and we elect ministers or parties led by those with histories of sexual violence. it high time to realize that rapists are not born, but they are made by the members of our society. Rape culture is embedded in our day to day lives, and outrage after a horrific incident alone will not eradicate this culture. Rape is the result of a long history of patriarchy. So, when you ask, \"how could they have raped her so brutally? how did they not shiver? are they even human?\" remember that we are all part of the system that allows this violence. it's up to us to address and change this culture. when i say we are all part of the system that allows this violence, i mean it's rape culture. rape culture is when sexual violence is accepted as normal. it's when patriarchy criticizes women for making their own choices or living independently and blames rape survivors for what happened to them. \n\nIf a woman is raped, she was \"asking for it,\" and if a man is raped, he was \"weak,\" a \"sissy,\" or \"enjoyed it.\" it promotes the idea of \"don't get raped\" instead of \"don't rape people.\" when you hear in response to a rape, \"she shouldn't have been drunk/wearing that/etc.,\" that is what \"rape culture\" refers to. it's rape culture when a woman is going about her business and men start catcalling her, either on the street or from a car. it's not about wanting to talk to her; it's about showing off to other men. Do you know how scary it is to be followed by a group of strangers making derogatory comments? or when people make inappropriate jokes that make women uncomfortable, and if they voice their discomfort, it's often dismissed as 'just a joke' and they're told to 'stop being so sensitive.'\n\nRape culture glorifies toxic masculinity, celebrates rape\n\"jokes,\" and criticizes women for calling out \"casual\" sexism. it burdens women with their safety when it is patriarchy that makes women unsafe. people shouldn't catcall because it's terrifying, and they shouldn't make jokes when asked to stop. it shows a disregard for how the other person feels. rape culture is when you defend ronaldo, who is a proven rapist, simply because you like how he plays soccer (the portuguese footballer admitted that 'it was rough,' 'she didn't want to give it to him,' and that he apologized afterward).",
            "First and foremost people should get taught how to respect women. People just don't know what is respect even. \n\nRape happens cause men want to show power, dominance and sometimes it's about taking revenge too. Sometimes it's to give \"punishment\" too. If it's about only sexual drive then 3 months old baby and 60 years old women won't be raped, and if any men say it's because of sexual urges and then you are heinous, horrible, pedophile and every bad thing in the world. Porn addict brain where the most searched things are non consented videos - it's just tell how these men view women. \n\nThe nirbhaya case culprit said \"in a rape a girl is more responsible than a boy\". A reporter went to tihar jail to ask 122 rapists to ask why they rape and a 50 year old horrible freak said that he raped a 5 year old girl cause she was provoking him and had a bad character so she punished him. \n\nThis kolkata case, where a 31 year old doctor was brutally raped and murdered cause they wanted hide some rackets that was going inside that hospital. Broken glasses inside eyes, broken pelvic bones ....this don't happen cause of sexual desires. I am frustrated with this narrative. \n\nIndian men just don't know how to behave with women and see them as a human being. And there are subs were people are busy to prove **not all men** i don't know who told them that it's about them and if those men are not like other horrible ones they should not be enraged at all. We are not talking about you. \n\nThese psychotic people are pest for the society. When half of the population should be always alert, should be always live in fear. These men are so horrible they don't leave other men, animals anything. \n\nEveryone talking about the Kolkata case now, have to protest just to get justice. The girl who suffered so much, who is going to take responsibility of those moments, no justice, no punishment are not enough. We should be vocal about how to stop all these. Why only protesting after rape happens. Cause already two more cases we got, one of them is a nursery school kid. I don't know how many of these will be enough when one was not enough.",
            "While I bet most people do support change, what exactly \"change\" means to you compared to the other 1.4B people is hard to conceive.\n\n\nIndia does need a massive cultural shift, but here's what I don't get. With so many different regions, languages, traditions, cultures, and beliefs it seems impossible to converge on a single new culture. It takes several family generations for that kind of shift to happen anyway.\n\n\nInstead of all that the government needs to write and enforce the law better with broad criminal reform and police reform. People will learn through corrective action if it's judicious and fair. The criminal justice system seems problematic to say the least in India so I propose criminal justice reform, CCTV cams everywhere, well lit streets everywhere, harsh and/or appropriate punishment for crimes, and more services and resources for survivors.\n\n\nThe next thing is women's freedom/independence in India and their role in society. Women must get organized, agree on principles they'll fight for, and stand up for themselves. Nobody is coming to save you or them. Post on social media all you want but to see the changes you want to see you need to gain momentum and support from like minded Indians. The more allies you have the harder it is to stop the momentum but the fewer you have the harder it gets. . ",

Seemingly this so called 4000-5000 years old rich amazing religion is unable to stop men who find a woman alone and vulnerable from harming her. Rapes happen all across the world, but in India it’s “just a matter of opportunity”, and seemingly all men may rape only depending on how vulnerable they find their victim. \nAdd to all this the marital rapes. Grandmas laugh when their granddaughters complain that their abusive husbands raped them. They want the granddaughters to “endure through”, this is what husbands and families are like they are told. For society they need the woman to be raped by her husband, to put up a facade of a successful married life. For who are you pretending, Grandma? And this is the mindset of UPPER CASTE HINDU FAMILIES WHICH HAVE MONEY TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO STUDY OUTSIDE OF COUNTRY. \nThe depth of this rape problem in India is mind-boggling to say the least."

I think it's fair to charge more to tourists for tickets than Indians. Actually the tourist price is the standard price while the Indian price should be considered highly subsidised.\n\n\nMain reason is that Indians are poor. As such many things are made dirt cheap in India by government subsidies. You can get a poori-sabzi plate for 20rs, inter-city railway tickets for less than 100rs, rice, vegetables and necessities for less than 50rs per kilo and not to mention how ridiculously cheap medicine and medical facilities are here. \n\nShit is dirt cheap here and that's thanks to subsidies absorbed by the government and by its citizens overall (more money into subsidies is less money on infrastructure and development so we're all definitely impacted). Because of this, short term visitors need not benefit from these subsidies and should pay the full price. \n\nFYI 750rs is not even $10. The average price of a ticket to any attraction in the US is $15 to $30.",

            "As a traveler from Manipur with roots in Bombay, I have a tale of mixed experiences from my journey to Aurangabad. Despite being born and raised in Colaba, Bombay, my family’s distinct Mongolian features often set us apart. We’ve faced our share of casual racism, a common narrative for many from the Northeast. This was evident during our recent visit to Aurangabad.\n\nIn Aurangabad, the encounters were a mix of curiosity and ignorance. As someone who understands Marathi, I could understand the locals’ comments. Some teenagers mistook us for Chinese, hurling wild remarks at my wife and teenage daughter. It’s disheartening, especially considering the Northeast’s contribution to national sports, yet we often remain unrecognized.\n\nThis reminds me of a town hall meeting I watched on a new channel, with journalists and industrialists discussing racism. A girl from Manipur raised the issue of racism in the Northeast, but it was brushed off as irrelevant. Such disregard highlights the persistent issue of racism within our own borders.\n\nHowever, it’s not all bleak. Among the crowd, a kind family stepped forward, offering us assistance. Their gesture was a reminder that not everyone harbors the same prejudices. But, it’s a stark reality that racism isn’t just a North-South divide in India; it’s a national issue that needs addressing.\n\nIn summary, my trip to Aurangabad was an eye-opener. It showed the complexity of racism within India, affecting even those like me, who’ve spent most of their life in a cosmopolitan city like Bombay. It’s a reminder of the long road ahead in addressing these deep-rooted biases.",

Since your childhood you are taught about competition. To get things done by hook or by crook.  \nSo its like a scammer producing a child and teaching him how to be a good scammer. Cos thats what he was learnt through his life.   \nAnd there is no solution to it. If you actually are a person that is 100% honest (which I doubt) then your best bet would be to move to a high trust society. \n\nEven I used to think the same, Why cant we have simple life. Like imagine going to a store and asking the guy about a furniture and telling him my budget. As he works there, he has all the knowledge in the world to give the best furniture that i can have. But instead he shows me the mot expensive one, And If Iam uneducated in that field, he will try to sell me something that is absolutely useless to make more money. \n\nImagine going to an insurance agent and getting the best possible insurance for you, instead of him trying to scam me with the insurance that is least sold cos its shit and hence has higher commission on it. And the agent wants to sell that to me. So its like people with immense knowledge in a field, want to use their knowledge to make the most money out of it. Which is absolutely fine but trying to sell a comb to a bald guy ? How morally correct is it ?   \nAnd I understand that not everyone is saint in other countries but the cultural difference is huge. \n\nMany times I have seen streamers going to some big store in America and the attendant over there listens to the streamers and only shows things that match their requirement. Whereas same streamer when visits a random Indian computer store, The store guy wants to sell the most expensive things to the streamer even if he has to fool the customers.\n\nImagine you are a very honest Indian guy and some random powerful politician/businessman tries to steal your land. You would obviously go to police. - Police wont file the case as they will then have to work on it, Which is obviously inconvenient for them. Even if they do then will ask for bribe. \n\nNow you go to a lawyer - Lawyer will charge as much as he can even if you come from a very poor family. And there is no guarantee that lawyer will remain loyal. There have been so many cases where lawyers have taken money from opposing party and willingly have put  ineffective arguments in court, resulting client losing the case. \n\nNow lets say you find a good lawyer and your case is presented in the court - You will lose a very significant portion of your life just preparing for the case mentally. Only to see the case getting next date over and over again. Imagine your land is captured by some good and now you are in court for past 10 years. Your land that could have been used by you for making more money, is now useless until the verdict of the case is announced.\n\nI mean its crazy how the life of an individual is in India. Not worth more than a cockroach. Whats even more saddening is that - Same Indian who is abused by this system will never raise his voice for the reform of this system. \n\nEveryday you open the tv and boom some random mfkers are debating Hindu Vs muslim. What we should eat and wear. If we should kill our neighbors if he eats non veg. Mfker you don't even have a road in your place, You dont have 24/7 electricity, You dont have a proper school and you are here fighting for mandir masjid ?\n\nIt just boils my blood but again its the people that make or break a country.

            " \nAt times, I feel a mix of laughter and sadness, reflecting on how, from a young age, I was inspired by an ideal vision of a nation built on freedom, science, education, and the philosophies of leaders like Gandhi, Subhash Chandra Bose, Nehru, and especially Vivekananda. His focus on character building from an early age always stood out to me, because he understood that the youth of today would one day shape the future of the country. For years, he worked to instill these values.\n\nIf Vivekananda were alive today, I believe he would be deeply troubled by the way the youth now talk about hatred, division, and authoritarianism, while disregarding their own history.\n\nIt’s almost ironic when our leaders use Vivekananda’s name for political purposes, yet fail to truly understand his teachings. In fact, if he were here today, there’s a good chance they would call him anti-national, given how his messages of humanity, compassion, and Dharma contrast with the divisive ideas that dominate today’s discourse.",
            "the biggest problem i see with india can be defined by a quote i read by alice walker recently - The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any.\n\nthe people of this country need to realise the power they hold. we need to stop settling for little and demand, DEMAND more from our leaders. anything good that has happened in this country for the common man, has happened when people have come together and demanded.\n\nwe need to stop trudging on. stop 'adjusting.' we need to get out of this horrible jo hai theek hai mentality, we need stop accepting the bare minimum. lay down our tools and say we will not work till our problems are fixed. we will not work for as long as you continue to let the the air around us be poisoned by builders and contractors and unregulated factories. we will not work till you give us better healthcare. we will not work till  you fix the roads. we will not work till you give us better public  transport. we will not work until there are open green spaces where my family can go to play or relax. we will not work till you give us better wages, till you stop giving the same starting wage as the one you gave my father, while housing costs are ten times that of my father's time. we will not accept this and we will not work.\n\nif every single one of us decides to lay down our tools and stop creating more wealth for the wealthy (because yes, every last penny of  their wealth comes through the exploitation of our labour) if we stop working, stop taking that local train stuffed in it like cattle, and instead sit with that mass outside the CM or judge or local politician's home, when we collectively kill the productivity of the companies that want to keep things as they are so that we just shut up and put our head down and meet their revenue goals, when their beloved share prices crash, watch how every MLA, politician, officer, capitalist, scrambles to fix things. this the power of the masses.\n\nonce we realise this basic fact, is when things change. there's no other way.\n\nthis is a great country capable of great things. but the people need to realise their power.",

            "At the risk of over simplifying, the entire population of India can be divided into 3 groups. I define them as the haves, the have nots, the poor and the exploited. \n\nThe first bucket is the people who generally get most benefits out of the modernization and development, like the top 10% -15%. This group benefits the most, at the lowest cost to them. They get access to top class education, healthcare, and jobs. They have great incomes, and even greater networking skills. This group is often the reflection of shining India that everyone refers to. They include top executives, managers, doctors, engineers, and everyone else earning big and making to top echelons of their careers. \n\nThe second group is largest in terms of % , close to like 40-50% of population who feel marginalized by the rapid pace of development. This group includes mostly middle class and lower middle class people and even some poor people who can see the wealth around them, who can see the opportunities but somehow unable to get on the bandwagon. They have aspirations, dreams to make it to the top 10%, yet somehow due to lack of education, income, or networks, they get left behind. They feel trapped, hopeless, yet continue toiling in hopes of making it big. In the end, they just get by. The cost of living in cities doesn’t leave them with much to support anything else. The lack of education and networks doesn’t give them opportunities they deserve. This group mostly includes people like cab drivers, hospital staff, people working at lower level positions everywhere, etc. \n\nThe third group is clearly the poorest. This group once again sees all the opportunities around them, and feel like they were left behind intentionally. This group includes maids, people working in menial jobs, truck drivers, destitutes, etc.. This group feels the lack of opportunities hardest as they struggle to make even a decent living and are often at the receiving end of harmful effects of development. They live in poor conditions and generally see no way out. \n\nThe last group, essentially a minority group in terms of % share of population are the exploited ones. This group many times and in many areas overlaps with the third group. This includes people mostly in remote rural stretches of the country who are most affected by the harmful effects of industrialization and mining etc. This group includes people who went on to become rebels and cause unrest. Of course they are mostly at the lowest rung of society and generally have no access to even the modest facilities that the third group has access to. \n\nThe above 4 groups cut across every religious group, and it’s possible to find them everywhere. Every cast, sub-cast, and social group in India is a combination of these 4 groups. India is a microcosm of all the 4 groups wherever you go in India. \n\nGenerally cross mobility between these groups is mostly limited to group 1 and 2. Cross mobility between group 3 and 1 or 2 is rare though happens. \n\nAgain this is over simplified explanation but one can see this in play in India whichever part of India they are in.",

Entities should work together with a goal of reaching a sustainable degree of harmony instead of competing ruthlessly. Stagnation, corruption, too many elites abusing their power while much of masses are left to fight over scraps are found everywhere.\n\nIt’s fighting for your home is what makes it better. You indeed need a very long breath and I understand the hopes connected to moving to greener pastures and yet often that’s often how one ends up with societies that crumble because everyone only looks for a better place as without roots too often is no sense of loyalty to one’s institutions and often a country slowly falls apart, not even mentioning the effects on the place people leave. \n\nIndia might not see any rapid development as a whole ( it could ) yet a high degree of regionalism can produce very positive results that exceed expectations if enough driven people work together. \n\nStand your ground. Find likeminded individuals from all over the your state, country or the whole globe. Cooperate.  Fortify where it is possible and yet be selective about what battles to fight and which to abandon. And most importantly don’t loose hope."

            "I (20) have faced sexual assault from the minor age of 14 and till today it hasn't stopped. I have been assaulted in all kinds of public transport. By strangers, tuition teachers, and senior from school.\n\nI am a nursing student now, at one of the top Govt Medical College in Kolkata. Funny i was supposed to take admission in R G KAR(the college & hospital where the incident took place). I always wanted to go abroad for my job, it was just a dream but the recent incident made me determined to leave India for good. \n\nThere is not a single place which is safe for women. If you think crowded places are safe then you're absolutely WRONG. Men will go out of their way in crowded places just to get close and brush their elbows on our boobs or even touch our thighs and crotch. All of this happens so fast that sometimes you don't know what to do because you're in a rush you didn't even see who did it. \n\nI have an uncountable assault experience now and each one of them has scared me equally. No we don't get used to it. No it doesn't get better with time. Each of them gives you trauma. I was 14 and in my school uniform when it happened the first time, in a bus, I still remember his face he was probably older than my father, someone in his early 60s. Can you imagine ? \n\nI just had to vent y'all",
            "At this point I really don't know what the solution is. We admitted India wasn't safe for women 12 years ago with the Delhi case as well. And yet just look at the yearly rape statistics since then and see if anything has changed at all. Shame on all of us as a country that we couldn't solve such a big problem even after a decade.",

            "We can make ourselves better.\nA few days back, I was driving back home and I saw around 2 kms before my home, a bike suddenly stopped near two girls who were walking back home.\nI realised immediately and stopped the car near bike to ask what they were doing. Luckily, had a small stick in my car and when I tried pulling it out they ran away. Asked the girls if they were okay and I asked them if they want me drop them home. They said they have to commute daily like this, har din kaise.\n\nI felt helpless and offered them water before I went home. It was a late evening around 9pm. So I asked them to take office commute around that time.\n\nWe can only improve ourselves and laws must be made very strict.",
            "Reading this as I was thinking about the catcalling encounters happened last night in a span of 1 hour. I was waiting for my bus to come home yesterday at 9 pm and mind you it was a busy bus station as it's a long weekend. So, it's a large busstation with a lot of people. While I was standing there, waiting for my bus, there was a bus in front of me and a guy sitting in the last seat was making kissing noises, whistling and when I looked at him, he made that weird expression while smiling, it was creepy af. I ignored and moved from there and walked all around waiting for my bus while I was walking, a man aged around 40-45yrs was walking past me while smiling and nodding his head, raising eyebrows. And he was doing the same thing even after passing me till like 10meters. So, I couldn't stop thinking, how do they even change? I don't have any hope of it. It takes centuries to bring that change in people. (If it's about night time or it's too late to be out when I know it's not safe out there or it's my fault to be out, these kinds of things happened to me in broad daylight on the road and not just me, these happened to my friends as well and all of them faced these situations in DAY TIME more than at night.)",
            "I read somewhere(don't remember where), that the solution to this problem is to make the smallest of the crimes against women punishable - eve-teasing, cat calling, groping, stalking should be punishable. \n\nBut women don't even bother reporting these things, they are so normal. It's so traumatising when a random stranger whom you did no harm just pinched your chest or slapped your butt. You're caught unaware and in disbelief of what just happened. \n\nNow many people are asking women to toughen up and shame the perpetrators right there and then. It's not that simple. They are perpetrators in the first place because they believe what they are doing is fine. They have really big and fragile egos. If a woman shames them publicly, who can guarantee that the man won't seek revenge and won't stalk her and make her life a living hell for the rest of her life? He might throw acid on her, or find other ways to hurt her. This is the reason I've never been able to shame such men publicly because I have a fear of the much worse things that he can do.",

The vast majority of you think rape is fine- it’s just about whether or not you legally and socially ‘own’ the victim. Don’t pretend you care. How many of you would even defend your mother’s right to consent to sex within her marriage and not have sex if she doesn’t want to? As a doctor who has worked with many women, marital rape is extremely common and the vast majority of Indian women especially of the older generations have experienced it and many of you are conceived out of rape, whether you want to believe it or not.

I live in a foreign country and I can walk around alone at 3 am in the middle of nowhere without any fear. Before I moved here I lived in noida for a few months and even though I loved it there I could barely go about my day without having a male accompanying me. Even in presence of male , the eve teasing was common. And when I moved to a foreign country I found myself having the same high alertness and distrust of my environment for at least the first few months. So I actually started trying to figure out why and how is it different . By the way this country is Singapore and such women related crimes were occurring till early 90s( though not very  common but still not u heard of) 1. Strict laws and even stricter enforcement 2. Being a small country played a big huge where law could be enforced 3. Sex education and respect +consent taught to kids .

When people garland rapists in India, the only message to society as a whole is that it's ok to rape; it's ok to murder, meanwhile keeping strict tabs on women these men know. This is not equality or freedom in any sense. Rape culture is not raping women. It's also seeing them as worthless, disrespecting their identity or individualism, and the reluctance to see them as humans either. And men have to step up telling the fellow men to stop when they see it unfolding.\n\nIt's natural for women to want to leave India. But what about those who don't want to leave or can't leave? Do we really expect women to keep running and not punish men? There's no country for women, absolutely none as long as these crimes continue and worse - go unpunished.\n\nI am a woman, and I am not leaving. I have faced issues since 7 and by the time I was in my 20s, I have called out the creeps. Including a full scene in bus when an older man rubbed his dick on my shoulder.

            "You’re right; the safety of women in India, and even in more privileged settings like top-tier colleges, is a significant concern. The stories you’ve shared highlight the disturbing reality that harassment and unsafe behavior can occur in various environments, not just rural or less educated areas.\n\nThe fact that such behavior persists among educated individuals is particularly disheartening. It reflects a deep-seated issue that goes beyond education and social status, often rooted in broader societal attitudes and norms.\n\nAddressing these issues requires a multi-faceted approach:\n1. **Education and Awareness**: Promoting respect and empathy through education from a young age is crucial. Awareness programs in schools and colleges can help challenge harmful stereotypes and behaviors.\n2. **Strict Enforcement**: Stronger legal frameworks and their strict enforcement are necessary to address harassment and violence effectively.\n3. **Support Systems**: Establishing robust support systems for survivors of harassment and creating safe spaces for women to voice their concerns can make a significant difference.\n4. **Cultural Change**: Encouraging open discussions about gender issues and promoting a culture of respect and equality can help change attitudes over time.\n\nIt’s important to recognize these issues and work towards solutions, both individually and collectively. Your awareness and concern are steps in the right direction.",
            "I want to preface this by acknowledging that as someone who no longer lives in India, my perspective may be limited. I absolutely agree that women's safety is a critical issue that needs to be addressed urgently. While stricter laws and enforcement are important, I believe we also need to examine some underlying cultural factors.\n\nOne aspect I think deserves more discussion is how societal attitudes towards dating and relationships may be contributing to the problem. In many parts of India, there's still significant stigma around premarital dating, casual relationships, and sex between consenting adults. This repression of normal human desires and interactions can potentially lead to unhealthy attitudes and behaviors.\n\nTo be clear, this absolutely does not excuse violence or harassment against women. Those who commit such acts are fully responsible for their actions. However, I wonder if normalizing healthy dating and relationships could help shift cultural attitudes in a positive direction over time."

You can live in the best flats/houses in India and create your own bubble, but man it’s the same shit show once you step out of your house. I don’t want that. \n\n\nA lot of People back home talk about house helps, cheap labor with pride but I don’t understand that sentiment. I prefer being independent, self reliant. I love doing my own chores.\n\nEdit: looks like some people can’t handle the narrative that being self reliant can be a good thing lol",

I could even save 50% of my salary with that lifestyle. In short, I lived abroad, I had enough money to live as comfortably as one to expect to live in India. Hated it still. You want to know why? Because you are treated like shit. It's not on the face, it's subtle. No amount of assimilation can make you feel like you belong there. That's just how it is. There's absolutely no sense of community. The only community you have is fellow immigrants, and even they start picking up traits from the natives. Heathcare is absolute shit if you're on public insurance and even in private insurance, as I was, things are inconvenient in the politest of terms. Getting a driver's license costs a fortune, almost a month's salary, even more if you want a motorcycle license. They make it inconvenient if you want your own means of transport. Not that public transport is great. The most non-dependable transportation system I've seen.\n\nSo you see? Even when you have money to be in the top 5% of certain countries, life is absolutely not convenient. Not claiming that there aren't people trying to exploit the cheap labour available to them in India, but your bias isn't allowing you to realise that it's majorly the folk who've never set foot outside the country exploiting their fellow countrymen and not the NRIs who came back.

            "I’m a Hindu. Till my stay in India (pre-Modi), I didn’t experience issues with religion and caste-hierarchy, first hand. Always been god-fearing though, but very egalitarian in values.\n\nAfter I moved to the West, as I experienced deep hierarchy/caste-consciousness among so-called religious and well-educated NRIs, something went off. I read, researched and explored everything about religion, all historical migration to India, value systems, caste, archeo-genetics, etc. While the “education” was on, I was being to exposed to appeal of Islam, Christianity, Jews, world history etc.\n\nHere is a gist: most of Muslim Indians were lower-caste Hindu at past. They couldn’t tolerate hierarchy-based oppression from upper-caste Hindus, and got converted when external Muslim stock invaded and became rulers. Afterwards, post-independence, politicians (mostly Hindu?) leveraged Muslim for vote banks and some of them became very powerful (UP, Mumbai etc.)\n\nAfter Modi, a significant population of upper echelon of Hindu got this Caliphate-like concept of Global-Hindu dominance. I know highly educated guys staying up late night to listen to dubious podcasts talking about rubbish like “once upon a time almost entire world was a Hindu kingdom”.\n\nI pray to to lord Krsna/Rama and don’t care what someone else is worshiping as long as we are following civil code and the constitution. All these talks/podcasts about “Global Hindu Kingdom” are just political Hindutva / political games design to trap naives.\n\nOn the other hand, more I started comparing my Hindu NRIs, and western Christian populace (the demography I was exposed to, not because I was fascinated by Christianity), I slowly found severe hypocrisy and hierarchy/caste-adherence eating brains of Hindus. There are sects and class-consciousness within Christianity too, but it’s eye-opening to observe how most white Christian behave with other white Christians without caring for social-status -  “priest-class/MIT/JPMorgan/FAANG/Director/Businessmen/…”. I’ve seen a white director of a company having a beer with a white plumber and chilling out, without any inquiries around social hierarchy. Most Hindu NRIs don’t follow injunctions of their own religious values, behave badly at public, overly materialistic and greedy, severely nepotistic etc. (first hand experience and consensus among white friends). Then I asked what’s the point of all those glorious scriptures (Gita etc.) if they failed to teach basic human values, tolerance etc. \n\nI was socially ostracised for not sucking-up to fellow NRIs in power, not encouraging their Islamophobia and over-grandiose theories “Hindus will take over the world”. It was so bad, that I was thinking to convert to Christianity.\n\nIf this can happen in 2018-2024 Australia to an educated person running his own consultancy, what would have happened 500-200Y back to lower-caste poor Hindu farmers. Think about it.\n\nPS: My Hindu father has fled from communal riots in Bangladesh, and I, first hand, know terrors created by Muslims. But unlike other Hindu-fanatics, I’ve learned to read history through an unbiased lens. The Muslim terror in Bangladesh (and instability in that region) has deep historical reasons. Brahmin rulers (esp Sena dynasty) has installed severe version of Varna/caste hierarchy over there since 11-12 century CE until Muslim rulers took over. Contrary to popular beliefs, Unlike Brits, Moughlas didn't intervene too deep into India's villages. Upper-caste Hindu Zamindars retained their power throughout. Due to strong Buddhist egalitarian influence situation was much better in the Western part of the Bengal province where religious harmony did exist. The trigger for riots during partition also has self-inflicted (Karma) attributes. Bengali Muslims were the majority in East Bengal, but they felt politically and economically marginalized under British rule and by Hindu elites who dominated the region’s economy and politics (BTW, if Hindu businessmen/lenders/bankers didn’t assist EIC, India wouldn’t have been ruled by foreign powers for 200Y. I’ve concrete proof for that). Most Bengali Muslims were poor peasants (converted to Islam at past), while a significant proportion of the zamindars (landowners) were Hindu. This created class and communal tensions, with many Muslim peasants viewing Pakistan as an opportunity to escape the oppressive land tenure/caste system. Of course it didn’t work out for them for various reasons.\n\nBTW, I'm against minority quota in education and elsewhere just because there was a historical injustice. Govt should provide prepatory opportunities than creating quota thwarting meritocracy.",

I recommend you to see \"Nitish Rajput\" video on Kerala Story to get better insights about the issue.   \nI still remember during the Lok Sabha election times , Dhruv published a series of videos criticizing only one particular party only, while a responsible content creator helps the audience to know the pros and cons of all the political parties, but dhruv was paid by INDI Alliance it was very clear. Dhruv never ever discussed the issue of WAQF , because he knows it does not fall in his propaganda machinery. Even in Kerala story video it was clearly evident that dhruv had been spreading propaganda. In every video of Dhruv I see a lot of similarity in his words with Rahul Gandhi, I recommend you to observe this. During Lok sabha elections dhruv was yelling \"constitution\" stuff and same thing came from Rahul Gandhi too. Similarly You can see other examples too.  \n  \nThough I acknowledge your concern that the people about whom you mentioned have expressed hate which I condemn.

            "> When did Indians, that too the young generation, get so blind and gullible? \n\nIn my opinion, It all started with the rising popularity of Social Media, and then it accelerated when the access to cheap internet became part of our lives and upbringing. We all slowly became easily opinionated and more importantly reactive because of what Social Media fed us, and how it changed our thoughts on doing a better fact-checking and research despite of us being instigated by telling us to \"to your own research\"? Did we do our own research or slowly sank into the sea of confirmation bias? I think the latter, and then this cycle continued to rot our brains functioning of critical thinking, by polarizing our society by pushing everyone including family, husband-wives, girlfriend-boyfriends, friends and then colleagues away from \"any\" form of opinion on any subject away from each other, if one's opinion is different from other but their opinion is more important than whom they're talking to. That's how we failed and are failing as a society, because of false sense of being knowledgeable everyone, including me, has, and everyone lacks humility these days.",

Here's some prespective from outside the country.\n\nI moved out before Modi became PM. Since then the country has changed so much that it feels different and unrecognizable now. Among the recent immigrants I have interacted with I observed the following growing every year\n\n- openly hateful, openly communal comments even when living abroad. Seems like these have been normalized in India. I have had conversations with recent immigrants and have sometimes been shocked by a casual remark that would be considered very hateful where I live.\n\n\n- hypernationlism that leads to people blindly defending bad behavior by other Indians, including corruption\n\n\n- this wierd India/Hindu supremacist ideology. This results in many recent immigrants not respecting host countries culture, breaking their rules and just generally behaving badly when abroad.\n\n\nMy cohort of immigrants including me were not like this and we find this behavior shocking. It has not gone unnoticed and is causing a rising backlash against Indian immigrants abroad. UK, Canada and Australia are cracking down on international student visas and other pathways commonly used by Indian immigrants. US already has country caps for greencard. From what I am seeing the days of Indians being able to easily immigrate to the west are over for good. \n\nThis souring mood is also starting to spill into the political realm. India's once excellent image abroad as a tolerant, vibrant democracy is evaporating fast.\n\nI would strongly suggest folks here to follow the news sources from abroad to really see how India's image has fallen in the last 10 years.",

But I always felt that I had to go for the throat at someone at a moment's notice. It was deeply uncomfortable living there. Nothing violent ever happened but I think I had some close calls.\n\nAn autorickshaw driver literally refused to take me home one night while he was driving. I lived in the heart of a large city and followed along where we were going on my phone. We ended up on the opposite side of town and it was starting to feel secluded and isolated. No people out, fewer buildings, and I could start to see the rural areas. After telling him multiple times to get on a highway, he continued to ignore me. I was in an area where I felt very unsafe. So dropping me off there was a no-go. Finally, I told him to drive me towards the city or I was going to grab his throat and choke him out. When we reached a populated area, I got out and didn't look back. But he actually asked me to pay him. I ignored him and called an Ola Cab which took me home.\n\nHe may have been trying to just run up the meter. Or he could have tried to kill me and dispose of my body in a secluded area. I had been in the country for 6 months and while I was used to seeing drivers take the scenic route, this seemed dangerous.\n\nI felt much safer in sub-Saharan Africa. Even though I wasn't. Got into a few car accidents while in cabs. People love to drive drunk. But in India I felt very unsafe at times, but nothing ever happened.",

Are these people not aware that illegal immigration can literally kill them and their family? Walking on foot across arid deserts in Texas/New Mexico or crossing ice cold rivers in winter across Canada or packed like cattle in a shipping container…does nobody even tell them that’s how they’ll be sent? \n2. Only 60 million households in India have a gross household income of 12 lakhs per annum or above. That’s about 5-7% of the total number of households. So if you have 10 lakhs to hand off, you’re in some of the most privileged families already. It may not feel like that because money saved isn’t exactly money free to be spent or to upgrade your lifestyle but it’s still money nonetheless. With 50 lakhs You can move to a tier 2/3 city buy a house send your kids to school give your life a genuinely normal and legal start instead of this. So what pushes these people to instead immigrate illegally?\n\nLastly it’s just really annoying to see this happen and then wonder why anybody with an Indian passport is treated like absolute dogshit anywhere across the world.

No one wants to go on a holiday, be told to be super careful of what you eat, what you drink, where you go, who you travel with, what you are carrying, how you are dressed - and then be harassed, stared at, hit on, followed and groped or worse\n3.\tCulture shock in a bad way - people constantly staring, asking for photos or sneakily taking photos, being swarmed by beggars, being overcharged or scammed, being forbidden from places (my white friend could not come into certain temples with me) \n4.\tApart from Golden Triangle + Kerala, very little awareness of what to see. Some yoga and wellness people associate that with India but now places like Ubud in Indonesia are preferred. Endless traffic and honking, air poll; and poor road and rail infrastructure also limits what people can see. And a lot of the historic sites worth visiting are actually poorly maintained compared to those in other places.\n\nA huge part of tourism is awareness and then people telling other people about their trip - very few people want to come to India in the first place, and those that do almost always have some bad experience. I personally know people who went to India because they were convinced by their Indian friends, for work, or for a wedding and while they had different levels of things they liked, they all found the noise, poverty, crowds and (lack of) cleanliness to be shocking, very uncomfortable and had no reason to ever return. Not to mention almost all of them fell badly sick during or after their trip. One friend got scammed before their trip even began - they used the wrong website to apply for their eVisa because of how outdated the official website design looks that they thought it was fake. Still got the eVisa though. \n\nIf people need to fly 8+ hours from Europe and US, they would rather visit countries like Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, South Korea and even those in Central Asia like Uzbekistan.",

I managed to get a UPI app working ( not so simple as a foreigner) and that has been game changing for daily small purchases.\n\nPlaces visited:\n\n1. Maha kumbh — got invited to camp at an Iskcon camp which was catering a free eye clinic. I did end up at the sangam at 1am on the 29th, and yes, i'm experiencing a bit of survivor's guilt. \n\n2. Radhakund and Vrindavan. I was fortunate to have a private guide, 20 yes Radhakund resident,  arranged through a friend who stuck with me practically full time for three days. 21km barefoot Govardhan parikrama capped off the visit ( well, he allowed me to wear socks for part of it).\n\n3. Rishikesh ( that's where I am right now writing this, poolside at MVT Rishikesh after soaking up some vitamin D). Lots of sightseeing around here, with private hired taxis, costing thirty to forty dollars per entire day.\n\n Rishikesh has pretty heavy mode of passion with its \"yoga scene\" replete with white women walking around in cameltoe yoga pants. But there's plenty of Goodness here if you know where to look ( e.g inside the gates of MVT and out on the streets, if you focus on the cows. I'm about to go buy some carrots and cauliflower and walk around feeding random cows.\n\n4. If all goes to plan, knock wood, next and last stop for this visit will be Mayapur, where my spiritual advisor resides. That's always a little nervous, because he might ask me to do something outside my comfort zone lol. But I do not expect to run out of things to do and see in three days in Mayapur. \n\nI did all this in under twenty days and probably under US$2000, including an $800 round trip ticket from detroit to Delhi that I found. \n\nJust some data points I thought I would throw into this discussion.",

Ever thought how that grieving mother would have gathered the courage to pen down the heartfelt letter???\n\nSuch times of distress??? Looks like it's a common occurrence for the company and your team is experienced in handling such matters routinely.\n\n>Though no words can comfort a grieving family, I have personally expressed my condolences and have shared my deepest regret for their irreparable loss. I received an anguished e-mait from Anna's mother and have taken note of her message with utmost seriousness and humility.\n\nWow! Just Wow! I am really out of words here sir.\n\n>I would like to reaffirm to all of you that our firm places the highest importance on the health and well-being of our people, and we will recommit ourselves to providing a supportive, healthy, and balanced work environment to you all. I would like to make this an on-going dialogue with you to ensure we are continually building a healthy workplace for everyone.\n\n>We have several well-being programs and open channels of communication available in the firm to ensure that you always have a safe space to voice your concerns anonymously, including through our existing Speak Up forum and Ethics Hotline. We will also create more avenues for you to share transparent and honest feedback on our workplace practices.\n\n>If you ever face challenges or need guidance, I will strongly encourage you to please reach out to your team leaders, members of the talent team and your support network across the firm.

But I've noticed that there is a romanticization of classism that springs from some cultures, like this gentleman's club valet behaviour that is a symbol of British class.

If you want housemaids and great service wherever you go, stay in India. No country is perfect it's all about lifestyle, culture and what you can and cannot live with. This will become abundantly clear if you spend a year anywhere outside India. So before making a hasty, emotional decision to move away, first move out and spend some time abroad to inform yourself of your options. No matter how much you talk to people or read about it on the internet, it's not enough to make such a crucial decision. And things getting shittier in India certainly is no reason as things are shitty everywhere. Systems anywhere are made of people. If the systems feel shitty, then ppl are made of the system. And this system came into place because we voted for it. Living in any country shouldn't be about patriotism or nationalist pride. So do your research, spend some time personally and then take the decision. As someone who recently moved to the US,  I found a lot about my own preferences and tastes that I was unaware of.

The last point is important as it does take a village to raise children and if young people are disincentivized for having kids (no childcare support within family/community, flexibility from employers, etc) they simply won’t, like we’ve seen in many advanced economies where the family units are now too nuclear. \n\n2. I know these stats are well corroborated by various sources but tbh I just can’t stomach that India’s fertility rates have fallen so much (I’m happy if they really have)! Outside of a small bubble of young educated professionals, it doesn’t seem like the urban poor or rural folks are having drastically smaller families — “keep having kids till at least 1 male child” still seems to be the motto for a large part of our population.",

Where is the community? This is not the first time this has happened in the world. Like they say in Germany: if there's a Nazi at the table and ten people sitting and talking to them, you've got a table with 11 Nazis.\n\nEdit: arguments are just getting repetitive now in the comments. You can read the comments if you like. \n\nDo i think every person of X fictitious cult is evil or brain-dead or silent? Of course not. Most people are decent and horrified. Or at least many. \n\nDo i think that within different sky daddy cults, different kinds of problems exist? Obviously. \n\nWhy i find this different is as follows:\n\nI haven't yet come across a fictional cult where the \"crime\" of being an infidel is beheading or something similarly violent. Or one where other \"crimes\" are punished in other ways that are similarly horrifying, and are also codified in their fantasy fiction.\n\nDo other religions have violent origins? Every religion is a shitstain cult. Even today, yes. They have just over time chosen to be less violent. At least a bit. And as a community. \n\nDo other religions have issues of gross extremists performing forced abortions/ forcing people to give birth (YMMV) or bombings or lynchings? Obviously. They're all cults. At the same time, i don't find that other religions have these acts codified in their text and are still followed by the community without any changes. \n\nMost Christians accept the horrifying violence Christians before them did. We don't hear any longer of people being drawn and quartered, or women being burnt alive. \n\nIn fact, we don't hear of women being burnt alive in Hinduism either. Because the community followed the law which outlawed the practice. \n\nDoes this mean everything is perfect? Obviously not. What it seems to mean is that there are and have been for some years vocal voices within these religions that actively campaign against the violent aspects of their own religions. \n\nAnyway these conversations are getting repetitive as i said, so I'm muting this. Please make sure people around you are safe. Irrespective of their community. ✌️",

And it will continue in an endless loop. \n\nI wonder how disconnected from reality one has to get to do something like this. I recently had a conversation with my Muslim colleague who admitted that a predilection for violence is very common in Muslim circles. It is a problem and we need a solution (as we need one for Hindutva). \n\nI do not want to vilify communities but honestly it is high time for sensible and progressive Indian muslims to reclaim the narrative from these violent bastards! Or am I too naive in thinking this is even possible?\n\nI see many of my fellow Hindu-background peers being vocal about liberal ideas, but not enough from Muslim peers.

            "Browsing through the comments, I can’t believe Indians feel inferior to other races. **NO, YOU’RE NOT**. Stop thinking that Indians can’t do it because of Indian genes!! The more you think of things this way, the more it becomes true; self-fulfilling prophecy! Maybe as individuals many of us DON’T have the genes but collectively as a nation we most certainly do. I have posted this in many replies, but you can read it here:-\n\nOnly some sports have genetic propensity for success namely athleticism based sports like running, swimming. But even that can be overcome by India as a nation. More about it later below.\n\nFirst off, sports like shooting, archery, and even skill sports like table tennis, badminton, need countless practice after practice to get good at. There will be a certain point after many years and countless practice where that sport becomes second nature to the player. The sport becomes an intuitive sport for the player. This is why they must start young, at the tender age of 3-4. No questions there.\n\nNow coming back to your genetic theory. Let me tell you something, all sports have players of generational talent or outliers. If an outlier is 0.001%, then in a country of 1 billion + , I believe this occurrence would be around 10000 people. Meaning, Indians may not have genetic propensity for swimming or running, but there will always be outliers, and this outliers can be a huge number considering India’s population.\n\nAlso know this: there are literally 2 categories of sports and some in between. **Static sports**, think of it as sports where your aim is to be in the best form like shooting, archery, diving, gymnastics etc. These kind of sports are  all about the participant being in the best form of themselves. The athletes in this sport do not ‘directly’ engage and compete against other athletes but mostly against themselves to be on target  for the points.\n\nNext is **dynamic sports**. Here’s where the sport ‘directly’ engages the athletes against one another, such as, tennis, table tennis, badminton, wrestling, boxing etc. In this sport, gameplays, tactics and strategies are so essential and most importantly adaptation during the game also known as sport IQ, must be very high. Think of how Lakshya defeated Lee Zi Jia in the first set only to be subdued in the 2nd and 3rd. Im pretty sure that more than just the dip in confidence and stamina of Lakshya , LZJ also kinda ‘read’ his game. Lakshya wasn’t adapting well to the changes brought upon by LZJ.\n\nDynamic sports is harder to train and requires a wealth of experience but static sports can be achieved faster and especially so if they start young. This doesn’t mean we need to ditch dynamic sports, but know that it will take time for the athletes in it to reap the rewards of their hard-work. \n\nNow, the most important equation here is anti- corruption, anti-nepotism. If we can get past that, India will truly be a force to reckon with in sports. Even if India cannot outmatch the US or China, it should be in the top 10 if not top 5.\n\nFinally, I need to understand India’s spirit and discipline? Is it an highly disciplined nation ? What’s your take on that? I do know that East Asians like Koreans, Japanese, Chinese are extremely disciplined and hard working. Are Indians like that too? If yes, (again, this is not genes but culturally caused) then we can be good at sports. Period!\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention, **genetics don’t play a strong role in shaping athletes in sports like archery, shooting, bowling, table tennis**. Hard work, practice, confidence > genetics any moment of the day for these sports. There are a few other sports too which are like this.",

Anything else - it may or may not work. One of the options is to check if you can get a Rupee card. This can be loaded with cash and then used easily.

It's a law, and they can't force you to provide your phone number.   \nA plenty of Prepaid Instruments (PPI) are available, both through order by app and on airports. You'll find a Preloaded Rupay Card Kiosk at nearly every major airport. Further, the new UPI functionality lets you use payments through Preloaded Cards on your UPI as well. Alternatively, as long as you don't need to perform very large transaction (upwards of INR 5K in one go), you can also opt for UPI Lite. \n\nNow I understand your frustration here, brother. While all of these services have been thought of, and provided, the execution is still lacking far behind. RBI is proactively working on making it more seamless, though. \n\nIt would help to pre-plan your trip when coming to India. A lot of these services can be availed online end to end so make sure you get these processed before you land here and get it delivered to your hotel room. \n\nPush comes to shove and you can't figure anything out, feel free to DM me. Happy Journey mate!",
            "So, I think it depends on where you are. Being a foreigner in any country isn't easy, but my partner is European, and we have figured this stuff out. Airtel does 6 month sim cards for foreigners, you only need your passport. Again, it's available where I live, but you can ask the airtel people where you are. As for money, depends on your card, but Visa should work in most Atms.Some don't accept it, but they'll usually have Visa written on the door. If you're from europe (idk if it works anywhere else) N26 is a great option for travelers and even allows you to have a google pay account. We don't use it, but I think it doesn't have all the features of a normal gpay account, but it does make some things easy. \nThen there are some shops, usually money exchange shops where you can simply pay online and they'll give you cash. Out here they take a 3% commission, but it's actually cheaper than ATMs sometimes (depends on the rates etc) \n\nI suppose once you get a sim card, your delivery issues would be solved, so I'd get that done first. Secondly, local restaurants usually do their own deliveries and are even cheaper, so just call them directly if you can. Google is your best friend in that case.",

            "This is not right, I live in Mumbai and frequently travel to Pune, Bengaluru. I used my CC all the time for payment at McD, KFC, Subway, Domino's, Local restaurants. I am not sure which city you are working in but you should not face payment issues. Secondly they accept cash payments as well.\n\nYou said zomato, and swiggy needs a phone number to order food, that's the right thing, how will they deliver a food without contact details? \n\nI travelled out of India as well, what I did was I applied for a forex card here in India before leaving. And I bought a new SIM card when I landed in a New country, I think it's not mandatory to have a citizenship, you can buy a new SIM using your passport also.",
            "1. I am amazed that people go to a new country and not look beforehand what the common mode of payment in the country is not spending habbits are of people.\n\n2. U can always order without giving your mobile number.\n\n3. U should talk to your travel agent.\n\n4. I was disappointed when other countries did not accept UPI",
            "Well, I'm sorry but the system is not designed for foreigners. It's designed/has developed over time accordingly to local people's preferences. \n\nI'm not trying to be unwelcoming, but please understand the system here and follow that instead of complaining about it. We do the same when we visit other countries."

            "**Mahatma Gandhi was called Rashtrapita (father of the nation) by Netaji Shubhas Chandra Bose.** Sanghis can whine about it. But the history cannot be denied.\n\n[When Netaji gave Gandhi the title of ‘Father of the Nation’ | Explained News - The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/when-netaji-gave-gandhi-the-title-of-father-of-the-nation-8399485/)\n\nAlso read,\n\nOn 15 August 1947, when India was celebrating its Independence, Mahatma Gandhi was in Calcutta. With the partition of India, the entire Bengal and Punjab was engulfed in violence of unimaginable scale, of murder, rape, and loot. Gandhiji, who had sacrificed his entire life for Hindu-Muslim unity, and vociferously opposed the partition of India, witnessed his life's work undone in violence. He resolved to stay in Bengal until violence was controlled. For the next several weeks, one lonely 77-year-old man traveled through Bengal on a pilgrimage of peace, in the midst of blood thristy mobs who were bent on violence. Gandhiji called upon the people to give up violence and to protect the people of other faith. He embarked upon a fast, hoping to end the violence or die for the cause. And sure as a miracle, Hindus and Muslims swore off violence, and peace was restored in Bengal. Gandhiji's mission of peace was so successful, that Lord Mountbatten remarked,\n\n> ...in the Punjab we have 55 thousand soldiers and large-scale rioting on our hands. In Bengal our forces consist of one man, and there is no rioting. As a serving offcer, as well as an administrator, may I be allowed to pay my tribute to the One-man Boundary Force.\n\nFrom Bengal, Gandhiji intended to travel to Punjab and Pakistan on a similar mission, before he was assassinated by RSS.\n\n[Gandhi: The ‘one man army’ behind the ‘Great Calcutta Miracle’ : IndianSocialists](https://np.reddit.com/r/IndianSocialists/comments/15qrf2m/gandhi_the_one_man_army_behind_the_great_calcutta/)\n\n> **Hindustan belongs to all** those who are born and bred here and who have no other country to look to. Therefore, it belongs to Parsis, Beni Israels, to Indian Christians, Muslims and other non-Hindus as much as to Hindus. Free India will be no Hindu raj, it will be Indian raj based not on the majority of any religious sect or community but on the representatives of the whole people without distinction of religion.\n\nMahatma Gandhi",
