Give my regards to Capiton [some friend] and my brother and sister and Serenilla [a family slave?] and my friends. I‚Äôm sending you my little  portrait through Euktemon. My [new]Roman name is Antonius Maximus.\nAll my best!‚Äú\n\nI want a movie based on *that*. Not like this dude specifically, but a ground-up, slice of life portrait of the average Roman soldier. Provincial joins the mighty legion, travels across the known world, ends up in a famous battle. Learns the horrors of war and how big the world is. We have the primary sources; the letters, requisition forms, death notices. Instead of another schlocky ‚Äúgreat man‚Äù epic, I want a serious modern war film, but set historically.",

Showing auxiliaries in battle would also be confusing to the viewer in movies, unless you consider that auxiliaries were frequently equipped with the same equipment as the romans. Maximus' cavalry in Gladiator could be auxilia and we wouldn't know.\n\nIf you want to learn about Rome, go watch a documentary. This is a movie and it's meant to be spectacular, not informative."

He shot an arrow in all four directions of the heavens, and each time the arrow fell in Jerusalem.\n\n> Nero then conducted another test: He said to a child: Tell me a verse that you learned today. He said to him as follows: ‚ÄúAnd I will lay My vengeance upon Edom by the hand of My people Israel‚Äù (Ezekiel 25:14). Nero said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, wishes to destroy His Temple, and He wishes to wipe his hands with that man, i.e., with me. The Romans are associated with Edom, the descendants of Esau. If I continue on this mission, I will eventually be punished for having served as God‚Äôs agent to bring about the destruction. So he fled and became a convert, and ultimately Rabbi Meir descended from him.\n\nAnd I'm not exactly sure if it's still him talking or if it was just a one-off comment immediately before this, but would be funnier to say \"Rav Yochanan what the fuck are you talking about\" instead of \"Talmud\".",

By the beginning of the reign of Augustus it had become as popular a holiday to the Romans as Saturnalia.\nIt was one of the rare events where prostitutes were allowed to make a public appearance. \n\nThe prostitutes would dress as gladiators and have mock battles in the streets. Plebeians dressed in colorful clothes and gave gifts of fruit to each other while ingesting large amounts of wine. On May 3rd, the last day of the festivities, prostitutes would strip in the arena and perform erotic dances until men could no longer resist and joined them to engage in ritual public orgies.\n\nFun fact: according to Suetonius, in the year 68 the emperor Galba sponsored entertainment for Floralia that included a tightroping elephant!",

Application of¬†damnatio ad bestias¬†to Christians was intended to equate them with the worst criminals, who were usually punished this way.\n\n>According to¬†Roman laws, Christians were:\n\n\n  1. Guilty of¬†high treason¬†(majestatis rei)\n    1. For their worship Christians gathered in secret and at night, making¬†unlawful assembly, and participation in such¬†collegium illicitum¬†or¬†coetus nocturni¬†was equated with a riot.\n    2.

In addition to lions, other animals were used for this purpose, including¬†dogs,¬†wolves,¬†bears,¬†leopards,¬†tigers,¬†hyenas, and¬†crocodiles.

This was mostly due to local land holders who saw no reason to be part of a Roman state that could not protect them. The waves of invaders that occupied more land and took more bites out of the Roman economic pie led to a nasty feedback loop. Attila in the 440‚Äôs was devastating to the empire. Even worse was the crushing loss of Africa which supplied grain to Italy, supporting Rome‚Äôs large population. It had less to do with corruption or morality and more to do with simply being unable to deal with such a large number of invaders with constantly dwindling resources. Lack of good emperors and generals due to so many reasons adds to this. \n\nAfter studying Hellenistic history especially the Diadochi wars, it made me realize that looking at history from a modern perspective influenced by EU4 (states are borders on a map) is wrong. States are surprisingly fluid and unlike today most people didn‚Äôt really have a nationalistic or patriotic connection to the state they were a part of. \n\n\nSource: the Huns and the end of the Roman Empire in Western Europe by Peter Heather",

Caesar, the richest man in the world at the time, was the leader of the political faction that sought to reform and expand the grain doll (public welfare) and his chief legislative priority was land reform, which benefited plebians and citizens of Rome at the expense of the ultra rich and ultra influential Senate.\n\nRemember that Caesar forgave everyone who rebelled against him only to be assassinated by those forgiven later. This was because of Sulla's purges earlier in the same generation - Sulla took dictatorial power of Rome and mass murdered the opposition to protect the power of the oligarchic senate because he hated the power that the plebs had been given in the form of the *Tribune of the Plebs*. (Which was a sacred office, and whose only power was to veto legislation on behalf of the poor.)\n\nDon't get me wrong. Caesar and basically everyone else participating in Roman politics was genocidal. But when it came to internal politics, Caesar is often given a bad wrap as seeking to overthrow democracy as if democracy was a good thing, and democracy actually worked. It wasn't, and it didn't. The Republic was astonishingly corrupt, and any efforts to expand the powers of the plebians was met with murder and suppression.\n\nThe entire cause of the later Republic's civil wars was the conservatives in the senate refusing to yield even minor, symbolic power to the plebs. Caesar broke laws. So did the Senate. Neither side respected the rule of law at the time, because both parties were acting in bad faith.",

He committed several strategic and tactical blunders and got his butt ya def to him by the Parthians.  \n\nHe was just like the billionaires of today.  He just got away with a lot more- which is saying something.\n\nAlso, he may have fought Spartacus, but Pompey was the one who actually crushed his army.   And that was because Spartacus committed strategic suicide by trying to flee north out of Italy from the southern end instead of escaping by sea (I may have the exact geography wrong but that‚Äôs basically the gist of it).  Either way, Crassus‚Äô military skill or lack thereof had relatively little to do with it.",
