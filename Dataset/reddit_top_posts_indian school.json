        "Title": "AITA for telling my husband that I won't punish my daughter for speaking another language in the house because it upsets his son?",
        "Body/Content": "This is a shitty situation but here we go. \n\nMe and my daughter, Anya, are from India. Our native language is Hindi. She 11 years old now. Her father died when she was 5 and I immigrated to states because everyone was trying to get me remarried to a 60 year old sleazebag because \"oh no. How ever will a woman live or raise a child alone\". \n\nI stated dating my now-husband when Anya was 6. He had a 5 year old son, Ben (50% custody). Me, Anya, Ben, Husband and Ben's mum get along really well. The kids were very well adjusted and they were genuinely happy when we got married. Whenever tensions arose, we dealt with them patiently. Let's just say after walking through the minefield of Indian family/drama, diffusing these toy bombs were very easy. \n\nAnya has a habit of talking in Hindi when she gets really excited. Sometimes, while talking to me, she starts talking in Hindi without even realising it. This wasn't a problem. If she does that while others are around, I would remind her and she would revert back to English. \n\nFew months ago, Ben's mum passed away and he came to live with us full time. He has a room already and we put Ben into therapy immediately. \n\nA week ago, Ben walked in when me and Anya were cooking and we were talking in Hindi and he started crying. He told me he is feeling bad that he can't understand what we are saying. I hugged him and consoled him and assured him that we didn't do it to exclude him purposefully. And then Anya started crying and apologised. The whole thing was just heartbreaking. \n\nSince then, Anya has been making concious efforts to talk only in English and I can tell that it puts Ben at ease. Yesterday, however, she was frustrated and started lamenting about school work in Hindi to me. Me and Anya were in the living room and Ben and husband were in the kitchen and they heard it. \n\nLater that night, my husband told me how he thinks we must start thinking about giving punishments whenever she speaks in Hindi unconsciously until Ben starts feeling better. \n\nI was horrified at this suggession. I have never pulled the \"She is my daughter, not yours\" card. But this is the hill I am willing to die on and use that card if necessary. \n\nWhether he likes it or not, it's her first language. Expecting her to always converse in her second language, even when she is feeling some extreme emotions is just cruel. Especially after she is genuinely making an effort to make Ben feel more comfortable. It's almost like punishing for her heritage or for her being Indian. \n\nOf course, this is a huge point of conflict between me and my husband. I think it's unfair to do this to Anya, even temporarily. He thinks me and Anya are unnecessarily making feel Ben bad while he is mourning his mother, while we can try and prevent it. \n\nBoth of us are conflicted here. Who is the asshole here?",

        "Title": "Uncle bankrupts his previous employer",
        "Body/Content": "Not sure if this is petty or pro or whatever. You be the judge\n\nMy uncle is an Indian doctor. In the 90s there was a massive doctors shortage in Australia so the government gave him citizenship. Unfortunately you still had to sit 3 expensive exams to work as a doctor in Australia. These exams cost thousands of dollars, only happened twice a year, had limited sitting spots/times and had arbitrary pass/fail marks. So many Indian doctors ended up becoming taxi drivers/small businessmen etc. My uncle decided instead he would reapply and go through Australian medical school. Sure enough being a doctor for 10+years makes medical school easy and my uncle was top of his class.\n\nHe decided since he was already pushing 40 + had a family, he would apply to become a GP (family physician) instead of applying to be a surgeon like most of his teachers had suggested. At the time many desperate foreign doctors where applying for GP residency. They would essentially get treated like crap. They would be forced to work unpaid overtime. They would not be given proper study time or leave to sit mandatory exams. They would pocket the meals/accommodation/study/leave allowances that you were supposed to be paid by the training college. They would roster you to work every Saturday/Sunday shift and if you refused they would give you a bad review and your training would be jeapordised. This mostly happened to foreign doctors as most of them would be in bad debt and highly desperate for any sort of work.\n\nWhen my uncle graduated, he applied for GP training in a practice that is located within an Indian ethnic enclave so that he would have access to religious food/schools etc for the kids. Sure enough this practice engaged in all of the above fuckery. My uncle would work every single Saturday shift. During his dedicated 'study' time he would have to come into work. He got reprimanded for not overcharging patients in line with their framework. Worst of all, when my aunt was really sick and hospitalised, they wouldnt give him any time off to look after her and the kids. The owner of the clinic was a white GP who was openly racist against Indians, Asians and Aboriginal people (who were a large percentage of the clientele of this clinic).\n\nMy uncle bided his 3 years and as soon as his documentation came through making him a GP, he quit that instant. He went down to the local bank and got a loan to open up his own practice. All his old patients quickly moved with him to the new practice. The first year he struggled but his practice quickly became known and word spread. Surprise, surprise foreign trained doctors actually work well and care about their patients if you actually care about them and give them appropriate wages/living conditions. More patients and more doctors looked to work with my uncle. Within 2 years my uncle had a GP practice that had 4 doctors, 2 nurses, 2 trainees and a manager. His practice easily rivaled his original teachers. He then started 2 more GP practices with the money he was pulling in. These practices trapped his old teachers clinic in a 2km triangle. He would advertise heavily and make sure he could take as much business from his old teacher as he could.\n\nWithin 5 years his old teachers practice went from hiring 6 doctors, 4 nurses and 6 trainees to just 1 doctor (his old teacher) and no one else. His old teacher tried to sell up his practice to other doctors but no one would purchase it given how successful my uncle's 3 surrounding practices were. He then tried to sell it to my uncle who refused to buy even at a ridiculously low sale price. Instead he waited for the bank to re-possess his old teachers clinic and then purchased it for a bit more money from the bank. My uncle then re-purposed the building into his main offices from where he runs his other 3 practices. He made sure to redevelop his old bosses room into a staff toilets just as one final tribute to the human turd that was his old boss.\n\nEdit 1: Thanks for all the comments and the gold. Im happy my uncle has brought happiness/justice (+/- lady) boners to you all. He is such a generous guy in real life. Im sure he'd be really happy if he knew what reddit even was. As for a follow up. He didnt even expand any further apart from those 3 clinics. Im pretty sure the land value of the clinics is worth more than the doctors business in them nowadays. Sorry if I didnt read your comment. There are so many discussions going on. For people asking if I had deleted it, im not sure why (or if it is deleted as I can still see it) it was/is deleted or whatever. Thanks again everyone. See you all around.",

Last year a few people mentioned to me that they would be interested in becoming involved in the process of listening to and rating music. I think creating a scene within Reddit where music lovers are paying attention to the underground artists that post music here would be amazing. I'd be interested to see how it effects the music scene. Maybe more people would discover new music that they love. Plus, having more people vote would broaden the overall appeal of the winners.\n\n**If you'd like to be a judge of next year's Reddit Grammys,** I invite you to join the [Official Reddit Grammy's Discord](https://discord.gg/v42vz2uQ4n), where we will be listening to and rating music that gets posted to various music subreddits!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---",

I messaged his mom and asked if this was okay and how late he was staying. She asked if he could stay until 10. I serve dinner around 8, so he would be eating with us. I cook a lot of Indian cuisine in my house because that's what I grew up making. My son told me his friend was picky and asked if I could make him something else. I keep fries and chicken nuggets for when my son has picky friends over. So we all sit to eat, and my son's friend seems happy with the nuggets, and they go to play after dinner. The boy's mom picks him up a little after 9. I get a text later asking why I fed her son frozen food when I cooked a fresh dinner for everyone else. I told her my son said the boy wouldn\u2019t eat what I was making. She said I should have made him something also instead of just getting freezer food. I told her I provided free childcare without notice, and her kid chose not to eat what everyone else ate. I continued that when I was a child, my mom didn\u2019t offer anyone alternatives to what was made, so he\u2019s lucky I accommodated him. She told me she wouldn\u2019t let her son stay with a child abuser anymore.",

The first messaged me and asked if I wanted him to manage the Reddit account. We thought about it but decided that realistically, what is there to manage? I have the password and email so I can keep it safe until I return. \n\nThank you to everyone that gave me the advice (except for the people that told me to commit manslaughter). A lot of people were saying how my parents are morons and toxic. In reality they\u2019re just har d set on their own beliefs about screens and behavior (which is funny considering they both work programming jobs). I\u2019ll take this time to work on my relationship with them and these beliefs. \n\nA lot of people were worried about my gaming accounts but I have found a friend to watch over them. It seems that I may finish the CoD battle pass after all. The stuff I got from the games was free from packs or finishing free battle passes. \n\nI still do have my computer for school though and my dad is thinking of getting me an actual pc because \u201cthe computers the school gives out are piles of trash and should be ashamed to be called computers.\u201d His words, not mine. Little do they know that the school computer restricts access to certain websites and if they get me my own I can watch probably any tv show or movie I want by... let\u2019s just say becoming a really bad egg.\n\nMy parents have explained that they at least believe that my mental health is deteriorating from screens but they want to hear me out. They just want me to follow what they\u2019ve put in place for a while.\n\nLastly, a lot of people put !Remindeme comments on the original post so when I do return, I\u2019ll do an edit on these posts, and post something on my profile.\n\nI\u2019ll answer comments as long as I can. As far as my parents understand I\u2019m doing something important so they let me have the phone for half the day today. \n\nBut until then, goodbye homies and homettes.\n\nOh also I am Indian, born in the USA\n\n\ud83d\uddff\n\nEdit: The time is nigh. I\u2019ll try to answer some more PMs if I can but soon it will be over.\n\nEdit 2: I'm back! Will post an update soon.",

Sorry for the error.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nFrom Jon Krakauer's *Under the Banner of Heaven*:\n\n> Out of the entire Fancher wagon train, only seventeen lives were spared \u2014 all of them children no more than five years old, deemed too young to remember enough to bear witness against the [Mormons].\n\n> Those children not killed were taken to Mormon homes to be raised as Latter-day Saints; **some were placed in households of the very men who had murdered their parents and siblings.**  In 1859 an agent of the federal government managed to find all seventeen survivors and return them to their Arkansas kin, but before handing the kids over, **their Mormon keepers had the audacity to demand thousands of dollars in payment for feeding and schooling the youngsters while they were in the [Mormons'] care.**\n\nThe Mormons had convinced a contingent of Southern Paiute Indian warriors to accompany them on the raid, painting their own white faces dark to look like their Paiute accomplices in an attempt to avoid blame.  From Krakauer:\n\n> The Mormon militiamen, [Mormon military leader John D.] Lee reported, \"piled the dead bodies up in heaps, in little gullies, and threw dirt over them.  The bodies were only lightly covered, for the ground was hard, and the brethren did not have sufficient tools to dig with.\"  Within days, wolves and other scavengers had scattered their remains across the meadow.\n\n> Upon completion of this halfhearted, hastily undertaken burial, according to Lee, the [Mormons] gathered in a circle at the site of the mass murder to offer \"thanks to God for delivering our enemies into our hands.\"  **Then the overseers of the massacre reiterated \"the necessity of always saying the Indians did it alone, and that the Mormons had nothing to do with it...It was voted unanimously that any man who should divulge the secret, or tell who was present, or do anything that would lead to a discovery of the truth, should suffer death.\"**\n\n___________________________________________\n\nFurther reading for those interested:\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/event/Mountain-Meadows-massacre\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Meadows_massacre\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Under-Banner-Heaven-Story-Violent/dp/1400032806\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Mountain-Meadows-Massacre-Juanita-Brooks/dp/0806123184",
