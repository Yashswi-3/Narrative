            "Is this a good build ? I’m looking for a decent first pc Build.",
            "From what I can tell, this will let you run most games on decently high settings. Sure, the gpu is a 2060, so if you really wanted to you could go for a 2070 super, 2080 super, or 2080ti to really maximize graphics, but for that to be meaningful you’d have to upgrade to something slightly better than the Ryzen 7 3700X. \n\nTL;DR This isn’t a bad build by any means. You’ll get pretty good graphics depending on your monitor.",
            "I have a 144 hz monitor. I’m just wanting to build my first pc for the budget of $1000. You think I could make one with that ? I’m a FPS player not worried about 4K gaming but I need my games to run very fluently .i live in the us if that helps decide if I could make a good pc with $1000.",
            "I’ll be honest, I’ve only gotten into PCs very recently so I don’t know as much as probably any of the other guys (I’m actually I’m the process of building my first pc). But most PC’s that would run on 2650x1440 with 144Hz will cost more than $1000. Ball park at least $1500 but again, ask around because I could be very wrong.",
            "However, if your budget is strictly $1000 you could easily build a PC for that. It wouldn’t be all shiny and covered in RGB, but you could probably make one that lets you play games on mid graphics. Try going to something like r/buildmeapc and making a post about your budget and what you want to get out of it. Just be sure to do your research on any suggestions/builds people give you, don’t wanna take someone’s word for it and end up wasting $1000 on incompatible parts.",
            "You can definitely build a system that will run 144 on high/high-ish settings (depending on the game) for $1000, it's going to be the 'computing' side that you'll have to skimp on a bit to get in there.\n\nCheck out r/buildmeapc :)\n\nOr just go down the rabbit hole of [pcpartpicker.com](https://pcpartpicker.com) and we'll see you in a few days. Rofl",
            "Yeah I’ve been on console forever so mid level pc graphics would probably be a whole different world to me. Basically what I’m asking is can a $1000 pc run most games with no problem ? But it just won’t have crazy graphics?",
            "How much would more computing power run me? If it’s not terrible there is no reason not to😂Jesus christ I’m gonna be broke soon",
            "Yeah I’d say you could definitely make one to play some CoD, Overwatch, and Siege type games on for that. Just don’t expect the life changing PC experience you always hear about. Those usually come from people like myself, who are about to dump $2000-$2400 into a pc.",
            "I mean, it all depends on how you're going to use the system. If you just need internet/office apps/gaming, you don't need a ton of computing power - just enough to not bottleneck the gpu, really.\n\nIf you are doing video/3d editing/rendering, that sort of thing, then it's a whole other ball game."

            "Hi Zach,\n\nI'm in the same boat as you, and have been casually researching parts for a few months now. Here's what I'm seeing. Both Intel and nVidia are releasing 'next gen' hardware in the next 4-5 months. Intel's Ivy Bridge and nVidia's Kepler both look to offer some nice shiny new hardware. Ivy Bridge is a simple die shrink of Sandy Bridge whereas Kepler is new architecture *as well as* a die shrink. AMD just released their 'next gen' video card, and will continue to release cards in the coming year. They also recently released their new 'bulldozer' architecture, but from reviews that I've seen, that release was largely disappointing.\n\nHere's a list of useful links of the hardware I discussed above.\n\n[Ivy Bridge Lineup](http://www.cpu-world.com/news_2011/2011121902_Prices_of_Ivy_Bridge_desktop_CPUs.html)\n\n[Rumored Kepler Roadmap (No prices or specs yet)](http://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-kepler-roadmap-leaked-technical-specs-release-dates-detailed/)\n\n[AMD's GCN Lineup](http://semiaccurate.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5939)\n\n[AMD's Bulldozer Flagship Benchmark](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/fx-8150-zambezi-bulldozer-990fx,3043.html)\n\nThat's the *big* news in hardware, I'm unaware of any other high profile releases. But this should help you start in the right place.",
