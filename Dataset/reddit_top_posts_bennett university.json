        "Body/Content": "I made a tier list based off this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin\\_Impact/comments/l0ac0x/i\\_hate\\_tier\\_lists\\_but\\_understand\\_their\\_usefulness/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/l0ac0x/i_hate_tier_lists_but_understand_their_usefulness/)\n\nIt's a long tier list for the 1.3 update, but I hope it's useful for some of y'all. I assessed the constellation powers of each character based off late-game content and left some additional info below each character's assessment. \n\n*This is not purely a tier list to show who's the best of the best, but rather a tier list that offers a different view on the varying potentials that each character has with every passing constellation. Standards are used rather than numbering them in a specific order.*\n\nSS-Tier being platinum standard and C-tier being bronze standard. \n\nThe order of the weapons and artifact sets are not in any particular tiered order.\n\nLate edit, but here's a *probably* easier-to-read and more detailed copy of the guide in google docs. The 1.3 tier list in this post is outdated and has been locked from editing. The 1.4 tier list has been updated with a new scaling and role. I don't have much experience with spreadsheets but I hope this suffices.

Encompasses overall elemental burst damage with cooldowns and reliability in mind. Single strike burst damage is not the focus of this assessment. *Transformative bursts like Xiao, Razor, and Noelle are not included because of their kits. Neither are deployable elemental skills like Albedo, Xiangling, Mona etc.*\n\n*Enabler:* The support that allows the damage dealers to maximise their damage output. This role utilises their kit to buff teammates, deploy additional elemental damage for elemental reactions and overall team damage output, and crowd control enemies.\n\n*Battery:* The energy recharger of the team.\n\n*Utility:* A broad category that includes healing, resistance shredding enemies, damage reduction, taunting, cleansing, and shielding.\n\n*Cleanse:* Removes elemental debuff from ally/allies with self elemental application.\n\n*Sub DPS:* Includes all the battery characters, detonators, and enablers\n\n*Support:* Includes all the utility and enabler characters\n\n*4P or 2P:* Four-piece artifact / Two-piece artifact\n\n**AMBER**\n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|C-|A-|C|B-|C|\n|C1|C|A-|C|B-|C|\n|C2|B|A+|C+|B|C|\n|C4|B+|S|B|A+|B-|\n|C6|B+|S|A-|A+|B-|\n\n\\- Pyro Ganyu\n\n\\- Her initial value is subpar. Elemental skill's damage is lackluster, slow, and has a long CD but it does provide a taunt and good amounts of energy. C2 increases its damage potential with the manual detonation of her bunny. C4 allows for two charges, increasing overall battery and damage output.\n\n\\- Burst deals a great and consistent amount of pyro damage over a period of time. C6 pushes her enabler potential higher by providing additional attack and movement speed to allies.\n\nRecommendations: \n\nMain DPS: Prototype Crescent (F2P), Amos Bow, Blackcliff Bow, 2P Crimson Witch + 2P Gladiator / Wanderer's \n\nSub DPS: Favonius Warbow (F2P), The Stringless, any recharge weapon with 2P Crimson Witch + 2P Noblesse / Gladiator's for burst support or 4P Noblesse for enabling support.\n\n**KAEYA**\n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|A|A-|A+|B|\n|C1|A|A-|A+|B|\n|C2|A+|A+|S|B|\n|C4|A+|A+|S|B|\n|C6|A+|S|S|B|\n\n\\- 5 Star Husbando\n\n\\- A well-rounded main DPS. Has the highest sword-held basic attack multipliers in the game. Elemental skill has a relatively short cooldown, okay battery potential, and a long range.\n\n\\- Deployable burst makes him an excellent cryo enabler, however his true potential is locked behind C2 as it extends his burst's duration - increasing his detonator and enabler capabilities. C6 increases his burst damage and reduces the energy requirement for his burst.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nMain DPS: Prototype Rancour, Iron Sting (F2P), Aquila Favonia, The Black Sword, Primodial Jade Cutter, any crit weapon with 2P Gladiator + 2P Bloodstained Chivalry for physical damage. 4P Blizzard Strayer for freeze comps and/or additional critical damage.\n\nSub DPS: Festering Desire (F2P), any recharge weapon with 2P Blizzard + 2P Noblesse /Gladiator's / Wanderer's or 4P Noblesse\n\n**LISA**\n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|C-|B|C|C+|C+|\n|C1|C-|B|C|A+|C+|\n|C2|C-|B|C|A+|C+|\n|C4|C-|B|C|A+|C+|\n|C6|C-|A+|A|A+|C+|\n\n\\- Strong ara ara energy\n\n\\- Detonator potential not completely reliant on elemental burst; her elemental skill is the highest damaging skill in the game at conductive status 3.\n\n\\- However, switching to her for burst damage could hurt overall team damage output due to her elemental skill's long charging animation and preparation.\n\n\\- Second ascension talent allows her burst to reduce enemy DEF, however it pushes enemies away and has a high energy cost. \n\n\\- Her true potential unlocks at C6 as she applies conductive status 3 on surrounding enemies when she switches onto the field which allows her to quickly set off her elemental skill without preparation.\n\nRecommendations: \n\nMain DPS: Twin Nephrite (F2P), The Widsith, any crit weapon with 4P Thundering Fury or 2P Thundering Fury + 2P Gladiator's or 4P Thundersoother\n\nSub DPS: Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers, Mappa Mare (F2P), any recharge weapon with 2P Thundering Fury + 2P Noblesse / Gladiator's or 4P Thundersoother\n\n**NOELLE**\n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|C+|C-|B+|\n|C1|C+|C-|B+|\n|C2|C+|C-|B+|\n|C4|C+|C-|B+|\n|C6|A|C-|B+|\n\n\\- One Maid Army \n\n\\- With low energy capabilities and a 60 energy burst, she requires a proper battery built around her to enable her DPS potential to the fullest. C6 increases her damage by a considerable amount and extends the duration of her burst. \n\n\\- Good utility with excellent shield and decent healing. Though, switching to her to hit enemies for healing can hurt overall team damage output.\n\nRecommendations: \n\nMain DPS / Support: Whiteblind, Archaic Petra (F2P) Wolf's Gravestone, Skyward Pride, The Unforged, Serpent Spine, Favonius Greatsword with 4P Gladiator's or 4P Retracing Bolide\n\n*2P Retracing Bolide's effect does not carry its buffed shield to other allies.*\n\n**FISCHL** \n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|B|B-|S-|S+|\n|C1|B+|B-|S-|S+|\n|C2|B+|B|S-|S+|\n|C4|B+|B+|S-|S+|\n|C6|A|B+|SS|SS-|\n\n\\- Has a flying machine gun for a Stand.\n\n\\- Excellent electro application. Oz can constantly apply electro on the enemy consistently and can allow any main DPS to shine with electro reaction damage. Her second ascension talent is a great quirk for potential damage.\n\n\\- A flexible 4 star unit, can be either a physical main DPS or electro support. C6 is her most influential constellation as it extends the duration of Oz and increases overall damage output.\n\n\\- Great battery potential. When Oz triggers an elemental reaction, an energy particle is given for every reaction triggered.\n\n\\- Lacks AOE damage, but does great against single targets\n\n\\- However, even as a physical main DPS, her damage is mostly carried by Oz\n\nRecommendations: \n\nMain DPS: Compound Bow, Prototype Crescent (F2P), Skyward Harp, Rust, Amos Bow, with 2P Gladiator's + 2P Bloodstained for physical or 2P Thundering Fury + 2P Bloodstained for flexibility\n\nSub DPS: Favonius Warbow or Prototype Crescent (F2P), The Stringless with 2P Thundering Fury + 2P Gladiator's or 4P Thundersoother. \n\n*4P cooldown effect of Thundering Fury does not work unless the holder on the field. Elemental mastery is weak with electro supports; Stringless being the only exception with its passive.* \n\n**BARBARA**\n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Enabler|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|C-|B|C-|B+|\n|C1|C-|B|C-|B+|\n|C2|C-|B+|C-|B+|\n|C4|C-|B+|B|B+|\n|C6|C-|B+|B|A|\n\n\\- Sadge Barbruh\n\n\\- Has high healing output, but cannot generate energy particles for her team with her elemental skill. Although her deployable elemental skill can apply hydro in a certain range, her enabling potential is pushed down by its long cooldown. Her elemental burst also does not deal damage and is hampered by a high energy requirement. \n\n\\- However, her utility and enabling capabilities do increase behind certain constellations. C2 increases hydro damage and C6 allows her to ressurect fellow allies in the party. C4 increases her battery potential albeit stamina reliant with charged attack spam. \n\n\\- Her basic attacks have good multipliers in comparison to Mona, however the rest of her kit does not align well with the main DPS role. \n\nRecommendations:\n\nMain DPS: Mappa Mare (F2P), Solar Pearl, Widsith, any crit weapon with 4P Wanderer's for charged attack spam or 4P Heart of Depth for basic attack spam\n\nSupport: Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers, Prototype Amber (F2P) with 4P Maiden or 4P Instructor \n\n**XIANGLING** \n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|B+|S|A+|C+|C|\n|C1|B+|S|A+|C+|B|\n|C2|B+|S|A+|C+|B|\n|C4|B+|S+|S|C+|B|\n|C6|B+|S+|S+|C+|B|\n\n\\- Destroyer of slime condensates\n\n\\- Great pyro application with deployable AOE elemental skill and elemental burst. An excellent support for pyro DPS at C1 and C6. Her second ascension talent drops chillis for additional attack damage. \n\n\\- A very flexible unit with high attack ratios. Her enabling capabilities spikes at C4. However, her overall damage potential is limited by her energy recharging needs and the small amounts of energy she creates from Gouba. \n\nRecommendations:\n\nMain DPS: Crescent Pike (F2P), Primordial Jade, Skyward Spine, Deathmatch, any crit weapon with 2P Gladiator's + 2P Bloodstained / Crimson Witch\n\nSub DPS: Prototype Starglitter (F2P), Skyward Spine, Dragon's Bane, any recharge or crit weapon with 2P Crimson Witch + 2P Gladiator's\n\n*The 4P effect of Crimson Witch does not work if the holder is not on the field.*\n\n**ANEMO TRAVELER**\n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|C|C+|A|B|A|\n|C1|C|C+|A|B|A|\n|C2|C|C+|A|B|A|\n|C4|C|C+|A|B|A|\n|C6|C|B-|A|B|S+|\n\n\\- Hurricane Katrina? More like Hurricane Tortilla.\n\n\\- Big knockback and crowd control with their elemental burst and skill; the con of knockback could be easily thwarted if played around with enough. Elemental burst and skill can be infused with other elements. Elemental skill leaves them vulnerable while charging.\n\n\\- Being an anemo pushes them higher in the tier as a support with access to 4P Viridescent Veneer. Very large power spike at C6 with its additional shredding capabilities with their elemental burst. Could also allow for other builds other than 4P Viridescent Veneer.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nMain DPS: Prototype Rancour, Festering Desire (F2P), any crit weapon with 4P Gladiator's for flexibility or 2P Viridescent + 2P Gladiator's for optimal damage\n\nSub-DPS: Festering Desire (F2P), any recharge weapon with 4P Viridescent \n\n**GEO TRAVELER**\n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|C|B|C+|A|\n|C1|C+|B|B-|A|\n|C2|B|A-|B-|A|\n|C4|B|A-|B-|S+|\n|C6|B|A-|B-|S+|\n\n\\- Stepping stone and king of rock tumours\n\n\\- Underrated detonator potential. Big power spike at C2 and battery capabilities increases a lot by C4. \n\n\\- Elemental skill has low cooldown and high damage potential.\n\n\\- Burst gives additional crit rate to allies and self at C1\n\nRecommendations:\n\nMain DPS: Prototype Rancour, Festering Desire (F2P), any crit weapon with 4P Gladiator's for flexibility or 2P Archaic + 2P Gladiator's for optimal damage\n\nSub DPS: Festering Desire (F2P), any recharge or crit weapon with 2P Archaic + 2P Noblesse / Gladiator's or 4P Noblesse or 4P Archaic\n\n**BENNETT** \n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|S|B-|S|S|S|\n|C1|S|B-|SS+|S|S|\n|C2|S|B-|SS+|S|S|\n|C4|S|B-|SS+|S|S|\n|C6|S|B-|S+|S|S|\n\n\\- Broken da broken\n\n\\- Elemental burst increases team damage output through the roof and cleanses the team with pyro. Fastest healing tick rate in the game although hampered by a 70% max HP heal limit. Low investment cost since his burst's damage utility scales off his base ATK only. \n\n\\- Elemental skill has a short cooldown and its cooldown is reduced by half in his burst at second ascension talent, making him the GOAT of pyro batteries.\n\n\\- Has great, well-rounded damage potential when paired with Chongyun or Xingqiu for melt/vaporise comps.\n\n\\- Bennett's C6 is the only detrimental upgrade out of the lot in this list. This constellation changes all melee damage into pyro damage when you enter his burst's field, ignoring infusions and physical damage bonuses; limiting the universal effectiveness of his burst. Albeit, it is a bonus for pyro damage users.\n\nRecommendations: \n\nMain DPS: Iron Sting, Festering Desire (F2P), any crit weapon with 4P Crimson Witch \n\nSupport / Sub DPS: Festering Desire (F2P), Skyward Blade, any recharge weapon with 4P Noblesse or 2P Crimson Witch + 2P Noblesse \n\n**DIONA**\n\n|Constellation|Enabler|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|B+|A-|S|\n|C1|A-|A-|S|\n|C2|A-|A-|S|\n|C4|A-|A-|S|\n|C6|S+|A-|S|\n\n\\- The better Qiqi \n\n\\- A high-end support with shielding, healing, and cleansing capabilities. Her cryo application is alright with her extensive elemental skill and continuous cryo-damaging burst; albeit slow application. Her shield and burst also cleanses electro debuffs pretty well. \n\n\\- While C1 increases her enabling output by reducing her energy requirement, her true support potential is unlocked at C6. This allows her to give 200 elemental mastery to party members healing in her burst field and also increases her healing output to a measurable amount.\n\nRecommendations: \n\nSupport: Favonius Warbow (F2P), Sacrificial Bow with 4P Maiden or 4P Noblesse\n\n**XINYAN** \n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|B-|C+|B|A-|B|\n|C1|B|C+|B|A-|B|\n|C2|B+|B+|B+|A-|A|\n|C4|A|B+|B+|A-|A+|\n|C6|A|B+|B+|A-|A+|\n\n\\- Guitar Hero extraordinaire\n\n\\- Her initial value without constellations is subpar, albeit well-rounded. C4's physical damage shred is recommended to increase her DPS and utility potential.\n\n\\- Mixed stats are an issue, she may seem like a pyro enabler at first glance but she's more of a physical damage enabler for characters like Razor. Her elemental skill has a long cooldown but it can increase physical damage, cleanse herself with pyro, omit consistent pyro damage (if level 3 shield), give a good amount of energy particles (can exploit Sacrificial Greatsword), and shield her allies. \n\n\\- Detonator potential limited by her burst's physical damage scaling and low pyro damage output. Her AOE burst damage is also comparatively small. C2 allows her burst to hit a crit and also re-casts her shield, extending her utility and detonator potential.\n\nRecommendations: \n\nMain DPS: Snow-tombed Starsilver, Prototype Archaic (F2P), Wolf's Gravestone, Blackcliff Slasher, Skyward Pride with 2P Gladiator's + 2P Bloodstained \n\nSub DPS: Whiteblind (if using her primarily for shields), Snow-tombed Starsilver or Prototype Archaic (F2P), Favonius Greatsword, Sacrificial Greatsword with 2P Bloodstained + 2P Noblesse or 4P Noblesse\n\n**BEIDOU**\n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|B-|S-|S+|B|C+|\n|C1|B-|S-|S+|B|B|\n|C2|B-|SS|SS|B|B|\n|C4|B|SS|SS|B|B|\n|C6|B|SS+|SS+|B|A|\n\n\\- Queen of Counters \n\n\\- Although her supporting capabilities are locked behind a high energy costing burst, her elemental skill provides a lot of defensive and offensive options with its short cooldowns. \n\n\\- Her burst does a great amount of damage and electro application over a period of time. C2 increases its enabling and detonator potential, and C6 pushes this further with additional electro shred.\n\n\\- Overall damage output is locked behind her heavy reliance on being able to counter enemy attacks. Enemy AI can be very random and forces her main DPS capabilities at a lower tier than it should be.\n\n\\- Her energy capabilities are also limited behind the counter mechanic, but this issue can be mitigated with the use of Sacrificial Greatsword.\n\nRecommendations: \n\nMain DPS: Prototype Archaic, Snow-tombed Starsilver (F2P), Wolf's Gravestone, Rainslasher, Skyward Pride with 2P Gladiator's + 2P Bloodstained for physical damage or 4P Gladiator's if hybrid or 4P Thundersoother for optimal damage.\n\nSub DPS: Prototype Archaic (F2P), Sacrificial Greatsword, Skyward Pride with 2P Thundering Fury + 2P Gladitator's / Noblesse or 4P Thundersoother\n\n**XINGQIU** \n\n|Constellation|Enabler|Detonator|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|S|S+|S-|B+|\n|C1|S|S+|S-|B+|\n|C2|SS|SS|S-|A|\n|C4|SS|SS|S-|A|\n|C6|SS|SS+|SS|A|\n\n\\- Unlimited Blade Works\n\n\\- Excellent hydro application, but heavily reliant on energy recharge to cope with his high costing burst. His deployable burst makes him a great asset to any team. Although his elemental skill has a long cooldown, it does provide great damage reduction, decent hydro application, subpar healing, and a lot of energy.  \n\n\\- Initial value at C0 is great, but his burst damage and enabling potential goes through the roof at C2. C6 reduces his reliance on energy recharge and pushes his damage potential even further.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nSub DPS: Festering Desire or Iron Sting (F2P), Sacrificial Sword, any recharge weapon with 4P Noblesse or 2P Heart of Depth + 2P Noblesse. C6 reduces the need for recharge, could use crit weapon instead.\n\n**RAZOR** \n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|\n|:-|:-|\n|C0|A-|\n|C1|A-|\n|C2|A-|\n|C4|A|\n|C6|A|\n\n\\- A wolf boy at all levels except physical \n\n\\- High single target DPS, but his \"selfish\" playstyle during his transformative burst cycle limits the effectiveness of other enabler and utility supports in the team. Elemental burst increases his attack speed to a very considerable amount.\n\n\\- A very well-rounded character with no heavy reliance on constellations. From C1-C4, he increases his damage output with crit-rate and enemy DEF shred. While most of his damage is physical, his electro output is considerably alright.\n\nRecommendations: \n\nMain DPS: Prototype Archaic or Snow-tombed Starsilver (F2P), Wolf's Gravestone, Serpent Spine with 4P Gladiator's \n\n**CHONGYUN**\n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|C|A|B+|A-|B|\n|C1|B-|A|B+|A-|B|\n|C2|B-|A|A+|A|B|\n|C4|B-|A|A+|A|B|\n|C6|B-|S|A+|A|B|\n\n\\- Big CHONGUS\n\n\\- While having the lowest basic attack ratios of all the claymore users, he makes up for it with his kit and constellations. Elemental skill buffs melee users by increasing their attack speed. He is the only character capable of reducing the CD of elemental skills and bursts (C2). Can shred cryo resistance off enemies with his second ascension talent.\n\n\\- Elemental skill overrides all physical and melee damage with cryo infusion, limiting the effectiveness of his utility.\n\n\\- Having a burst with very high damage multipliers makes his detonator potential on par with Zhongli and Mona. At C6, he gains an extra blade and an amplification to burst potential depending on remaining health.\n\nRecommendations: \n\nMain DPS: Prototype Archaic (F2P), Wolf's Gravestone, Skyward Pride, any crit weapon with 4P Gladiator's or 2P Blizzard + 2P Gladiator's\n\nSub DPS: Prototype Archaic (F2P), Sacrificial Greatsword, Skyward Pride, any recharge or crit weapon with 4P Noblesse or 2P Noblesse + 2P Wanderer's / Blizzard\n\n**SUCROSE** \n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|C|B|S|B+|A-|\n|C1|C+|B|S|A+|A|\n|C2|C+|B+|S+|A+|A|\n|C4|B+|B+|S+|S+|A+|\n|C6|B+|B+|SS|S+|A+|\n\n\\- Anemo wallflower, that other Venti\n\n\\- Has the highest support ceiling in the game; scales very well with an elemental mastery packed build.\n\n\\- Capable of crowd controlling enemies, anemo debuffing, and increasing the team's elemental mastery. Her support potential shines at C4 where she can easily obtain her elemental skill with her basic attacks allowing her kit to shine without worry of cooldown.\n\n\\- As an anemo catalyst user, she can become an on-field enabling carry with Fischl, Beidou, and Xingqiu behind her back dealing damage with burst deployables + 4P Viridescent triggers. C4+ is recommended.\n\nRecommendations: \n\nMain DPS / Sub DPS / Support: Mappa Mare, Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers (F2P), Sacrificial Fragments, Favonius Codex with 4P Viridescent \n\n**NINGGUANG** \n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|A-|A|B-|C|C|\n|C1|A|A|B-|C|C|\n|C2|S|S|B-|A|C|\n|C4|S|S|B-|A|C|\n|C6|S+|S+|B-|A|C|\n\n\\- Missile Launcher, Queen of Geo\n\n\\- Despite being limited by her element, she is still able to compete with top tier damage dealers due to her high damage multipliers and short animation casts. She unlocks her highest damage potential at C6.\n\n\\- First ascension talent removes the need for stamina when using her charged attacks after a basic attack, greatly increasing her damage output.\n\n\\- Capable niche support for geo teams. Able to buff the team's geo damage with her deployable elemental skill. C2 also pushes her enabling, bursting, and battery potential by increasing her own damage output and provides additional energy to the team with its multiple elemental skill casts.\n\nRecommendations: \n\nMain DPS: Twin Nephrite (F2P), Solar Pearl, The Widsith, Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds, Skyward Atlas, Memory of Dust, any crit weapon with 2P Archaic + 2P Gladiator's\n\nSub DPS / Support: Thrilling Tales of Dragon Slayers (F2P) Favonius Codex, The Widsith, any recharge or crit weapon with 2P Archaic + 2P Noblesse or 4P Noblesse or 4P Archaic\n\n**ZHONGLI**\n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|A|A+|S+|B|SS|\n|C1|A|A+|S+|B|SS|\n|C2|A|A+|S+|B|SS|\n|C4|A|A+|SS|B|SS|\n|C6|A|A+|SS|B|SS+|\n\n\\- CEO of GEO\n\n\\- With his shield being capable of shredding all elemental and physical damage resistances and having 100% uptime potential and petrification from his burst being capable of stunning large enemies, he is an optimal pick in all comps.\n\n\\- Second ascension talent and shield shred combined doubles his basic attack and elemental skill damage with additional HP% scaling. Deployable elemental skill does decent damage, but the energy recharge is random and its area of effect is relatively small. \n\n\\- C4 greatly increases his enabling potential by extending the petrification status of enemies and the size of his burst. C6 expands his role as another healer, removing the need for an additional healing support in the team. \n\nRecommendations:\n\nMain DPS: Crescent Pike (F2P), Staff of Homa, Primordial Jade, Deathmatch, any crit weapon with 2P Gladiator's + 2P Bloodstained / Archaic or 4P Gladiator's or 4P Retracing Bolide\n\nSub DPS / Support: Prototype Starglitter (F2P), Skyward Spine, Favonius Lance, Black Tassel, any crit or recharge weapon with 2P Archaic Petra + 2P Noblesse or 4P Noblesse or 4P Archaic\n\n**XIAO**\n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|\n|:-|:-|\n|C0|SS|\n|C1|SS|\n|C2|SS|\n|C4|SS|\n|C6|SS+|\n\n\\- Plunge attack spam is no joke.\n\n\\- With the highest character base ATK combined with his transformative burst, his damage output is considered the highest in the game *when considering other units and their solo output*. With his burst time and talent passives assessed, his damage potential is comparable to Diluc's vaporise comp. \n\n\\- Overall main DPS potential is limited by his high energy cost of his burst and the technicality of frame-perfect plunges. For optimal damage and uptime, he requires another anemo to battery his burst and some energy recharge built into his kit. \n\n\\- C6 solidifies his position in the highest tier and changes his playstyle in accordance to his elemental skill. \n\nRecommendations: \n\nMain DPS: Prototype Starglitter (F2P), Primordial Jade, Staff of Homa, Blackcliff Pole, Deathmatch, Skyward Spine, any crit weapon with 2P Viridescent + 2P Gladiator's\n\n**TARTAGLIA**\n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|A+|S+|S+|B|\n|C1|A+|S+|S+|B|\n|C2|A+|S+|S+|A|\n|C4|S|SS-|SS|A|\n|C6|SS-|SS|SS+|A|\n\n\\- Who? I only know Childe.\n\n\\- Overall damage output is hampered by the long cooldown on his elemental skill and has subpar damage against solo enemies, however he has high detonator potential against mobs of enemies. Elemental burst has very high scaling in both melee and ranged form. Elemental skill also does an excellent amount of damage against mobs due to its riptide passive which spreads hydro debuffs against enemies in a small period of time (effect varies C4+).\n\n\\- Has excellent on-field enabling carry potential like Sucrose due to the individual elemental reaction procs that riptide creates. To maximise team damage potential, he is best paired with Fischl, Beidou, Xingqiu, Xiangling. Enabling potential is greatly increased at C4. Riptide automatically triggers every 4 seconds his elemental skill lasts, greatly increasing his hydro application and damage. C6 completely removes the cooldown of his elemental skill.\n\n\\- A very expensive unit to build around in comparison to other 5 stars.\n\nRecommendations: \n\nMain DPS: Prototype Crescent (F2P), Rust, Skyward Harp, Viridescent Hunt with 4P Heart of Depth \n\nSub DPS: Prototype Crescent, Favonius Warbow (F2P), The Stringless with 2P Noblesse + 2P Heart of Depth / Wanderer's \n\n**GANYU**\n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|SS|SS|S|B|B|\n|C1|SS+|SS|S|B|B+|\n|C2|SS+|SS|S|B+|A|\n|C4|SS+|SS+|S+|B+|A|\n|C6|SS+|SS+|S+|B+|A|\n\n\\- Cryo Bazooka\n\n\\- Theoretically, she has the highest damage output in the game with a melt comp + 4P Wanderer's Troupe; albeit skill ceiling is higher than most other main DPS'. Her charged attack and frostflake bloom damage has excellent damage output. Arguably, C1 is her most influential DPS constellation as it reduces cryo resistance and gives her bonus energy. \n\n\\- Her enabling potential is also pretty solid. While being an occassional drawback for melt teams, her burst's overwhelming cryo application with its almost 100% uptime potential is well suited for freeze comps. Her second ascension talent also gives bonus cryo damage to allies in her burst's field. Her enabling potential is slightly increased at C4 as it increases the amount of incoming damage enemies take in her burst.\n\n\\- Best paired with Venti / Sucrose when casting her burst; ice shards do AOE cryo damage and deal a significant amount when enemies are stacked together.\n\nRecommendations: \n\nMain DPS: Prototype Crescent (F2P), Amos Bow, Blackcliff Bow with 4P Wanderer's for melt comps, 4P Blizzard for freeze comps, 2P Blizzard + 2P Gladiator's for flexibility\n\nSub DPS / Support: Favonius Warbow, Prototype Crescent (F2P), The Stringless with 2P Blizzard + 2P Noblesse \n\n**ALBEDO**\n\n|Constellation|Detonator|Enabler|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|A-|S|A|B+|\n|C1|A-|S|A+|B+|\n|C2|A|S|A+|B+|\n|C4|A|S+|A+|B+|\n|C6|A|S+|A+|B+|\n\n\\- Alfredo, SMUGbedo\n\n\\- A decent battery capable of crystallizing shields off-field and buffing the team with bonus elemental mastery. His elemental skill lasts 30 seconds on the field and procs AOE geo damage in a large radius with damage potential being comparable to Fischl's Oz.\n\n\\- Mixed stats but relatively cheap to build; primarily uses DEF for damage output and his best in slot weapon is a 3-star sword. C2 solidifies DEF as his main stat to build and greatly increases the amount of damage his burst deals  \n\n\\- Elemental skill procs have a random chance of generating energy. C1 slightly increases battery output.\n\n\\- C4 and C6 increases his enabling capabilities. A solid niche pick for Xiao and defensive teams utilising crystallise respectively.\n\nRecommendations: \n\nSub DPS / Support: Harbinger of Dawn, Festering Desire (F2P), Blackcliff Longsword, any crit weapon with 2P Archaic Petra + 2P Noblesse / 2P Gamblers / 2P Defenders or 4P Archaic or 4P Noblesse\n\n**QIQI**\n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|C-|C|B-|C-|B+|\n|C1|C-|C|B-|C-|B+|\n|C2|C|C|B-|C-|B+|\n|C4|C|C|B-|C-|A-|\n|C6|C|C|B-|C-|A|\n\n\\- Hu Tao's best mate, #buffqiqi\n\n\\- Great healing output. However, she shares the same cons as Barbara. Her damage ratios are low and her elemental skill does not generate any particles while in use. Her deployable elemental skill's cryo application is also considerably slow.\n\n\\- While being only a heal bot, she does provide some utility at C4 which allows her to reduce the attack damage of enemies and C6 which allows her to resurrect fallen allies.\n\n\\- Damage potential is limited by the large energy requirement of her burst. Even though attack is her primary stat, her basic attack multipliers are very subpar in comparison to Kaeya. At C2, she gets a small boost in her basic attack damage output against enemies affected by cryo. \n\nRecommendations:\n\nMain DPS: Prototype Rancour (F2P), Aquila Favonia, any crit weapon with 2P Gladiator's + 2P Bloodstained or 4P Gladiator's or 4P Blizzard \n\nSub DPS / Support: Prototype Rancour (F2P), Sacrificial Sword, any recharge or atk% weapon with 4P Maiden's for full support or 2P Maiden + 2P Noblesse / Gladiator's / Bloodstained / Blizzard for flexibility or 2P Blizzard + 2P Noblesse / Gladiator's for sub DPS.\n\n**JEAN**\n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|B+|A+|A|A-|SS|\n|C1|A|A+|A|A-|SS|\n|C2|A|A+|S|A-|SS|\n|C4|A+|A+|S|A-|SS+|\n|C6|A+|A+|S|A-|SS+|\n\n\\- Dandelion TIGHTS\n\n\\- The flexibility of her kit makes her a great fit in any team. Being a healer, cleanser, crowd control check, an anemo debuffer, and a battery, she can fulfil the role of many in one support slot. Her enabling potential is pushed higher at C2 where she gives the team additional movement and attack speed when she retrieves an energy orb.\n\n\\- Elemental skill and burst have excellent damage multipliers. Second talent ascension reduces the amount of energy required for her burst.\n\n\\- Charged attack is unique in comparison to other sword users, allowing her to crowd control her enemies into the air and deal an excellent amount of damage. She's also one of the only physical damage users who can use 4P Bloodstained Chivalry properly. Paired with her elemental skill, her fall damage exploit can be manipulated to deal a high amount of damage relative to the enemy's total health.\n\n\\- DPS potential is increased at C1 as her elemental skill gains additional damage and pulling strength. C4 also shreds anemo resistance off enemies by a considerable amount.\n\nRecommendations: \n\nMain DPS: Prototype Rancour or Festering Desire (F2P), Primordial Jade, Aquila Favonia, any crit weapon with 4P Gladiator's Finale for hybrid damage or 4P Bloodstained Chivalry for charged attack spam or 2P Gladiator's + 2P Bloodstained / 2P Viridescent for flexibility\n\nSub DPS / Support: Festering Desire or Prototype Rancour (F2P), any recharge or atk% weapon with 4P Viridescent Veneer or 4P Noblesse or 4P Maiden or 2P Gladiator's + 2P Viridescent / 2P Bloodstained / 2P Noblesse \n\n**KLEE**\n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery|Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|SS|B|A-|A|C|\n|C1|SS|B+|A-|A|C|\n|C2|SS+|B+|A-|A|A|\n|C4|SS+|S|A-|A|A|\n|C6|SS+|S|S|SS|A|\n\n\\- Terrorist, Destroyer of Worlds\n\n\\- Initial value is great as a main DPS. Deals consistent AOE pyro damage with her kit. Her output is comparable to Diluc's, however she is more stamina reliant and has some difficulty proc-ing reactions. \n\n\\- Enabling and utility potential increases with C2 which allows her to reduce enemy defence by a considerable lot with her elemental skill and C4 which turns her into a detonator when her elemental burst goes off. C6 gives additional energy and pyro damage to her teammates when she uses her burst.\n\nRecommendations: \n\nMain DPS: Mappa Mare (F2P), Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds, Skyward Atlas, The Widsith with 4P Crimson Witch or 4P Wanderer's Troupe\n\nSub DPS: Mappa Mare (F2P), The Widsith with 2P Crimson Witch + 2P Gladiator's  (or 2P Noblesse if C4)\n\n**MONA**\n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|B|A|SS|B|B|\n|C1|B|A+|SS+|B|B|\n|C2|A-|A+|SS+|B|B|\n|C4|A-|A+|SS+|B|B|\n|C6|A|A+|SS+|B|B|\n\n\\- Alternate sprint go brrrr\n\n\\- A staple in high DPS damage showcases. Her elemental burst is a considerable asset as it can amplify team damage output by a great amount, crowd control mobs of enemies, apply hydro to a large AOE, and work well in tandem with elemental reaction comps. At C1, the elemental reaction damage output of her burst increases by a considerable amount.\n\n\\- Receives energy recharge when she ascends. Her deployable elemental skill provides a taunt, a considerable amount of energy, and consistent hydro application, however it does have a long cooldown which hampers on her utility potential.\n\n\\- C2 pushes main DPS potential higher; allowing her to randomly proc charged attacks with basic attack spam. C6 also scales up the damage potential of her charged attacks.\n\nRecommendations: \n\nMain DPS: Mappa Mare (F2P), any crit weapon with 4P Wanderer's for elemental reactions and charged attack spam or 4P Heart of Depth for flexibility\n\nSub DPS: Mappa Mare (F2P), The Widsith, Favonius Codex with 2P Noblesse + 2P Wanderer's/ Heart of Depth or 4P Noblesse\n\n**KEQING** \n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|S|A+|\n|C1|S|A+|\n|C2|S|A+|\n|C4|S+|S-|\n|C6|S+|S-|\n\n\\- Kekw-ing\n\n\\- Charged attack spam is the fastest in the game and deals a very high amount of damage in a short window of time. Gains crit damage as an ascension stat and additional crit rate + energy recharge when using her burst. \n\n\\- Low energy costing burst; can deal a great amount of damage in a short period of time.\n\n\\- Overall damage output heavily reliant on stamina. Her charged attack stamina cost is slightly higher than other sword users. Constellations and kit don't address this issue. \n\nRecommendations: \n\nMain DPS / Detonator: Prototype Rancour (F2P), Primordial Jade, Summit Shaper, Aquila Favonia, any crit weapon with 2P Thundering Fury + 2P Gladiator's for flexibility or 4P Thundersoother for optimal damage output or 2P Gladiator's + 2P Bloodstained for physical damage \n\n**VENTI**\n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery |Utility|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|A-|S|SS|SS+|S+|\n|C1|A-|S|SS|SS+|S+|\n|C2|A|S|SS|SS+|SS|\n|C4|A+|S+|SS|SS+|SS|\n|C6|S|SS-|SS|SS+|SS+|\n\n\\- Sadge alocoholic\n\n\\- His burst trivialises a lot of the content in the game as it is capable of absorbing other elements, crowd controlling mobs of enemies in a large radius, and dealing an incredible amount of damage. His enabling capabilities are also boosted by his ascension talents which reduce the energy cost of his 60 energy burst and his ascension stat which gives additional energy recharge. C2 allows for additional shred on top of Viridescent Veneer and C6 shreds on top of that shred. \n\n\\- His elemental burst coupled with Stringless greatly increases his damage potential. From C2 and beyond, his constellations increase his damage output by a considerable amount. \n\nRecommendations: \n\nMain DPS: Prototype Crescent (F2P), Stringless, Skyward Harp with 2P Viridescent + 2P Gladiator's / 2P Noblesse or 4P Viridescent\n\nSub DPS / Support: Favonius Warbow (F2P), Stringless with 4P Viridescent or 4P Noblesse\n\n**DILUC**\n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|SS|S|\n|C1|SS|S|\n|C2|SS+|S|\n|C4|SS+|S+|\n|C6|SS+|S+|\n\n\\- Budget Bennett\n\n\\- The first platinum standard damage dealer since the game's release. Excellent pyro damage potential with low technicality and high damage ratios. Pyro infusion from his elemental burst combined with his low cooldowns validates him as an excellent pick with enablers like Xingqiu to maximise overall team damage output. All of his constellations are a considerable damage boost to his DPS potential and solidify his place in the highest tier. \n\n\\- Burst deals AOE pyro damage in a large range, but can be hard to land all his damage multipliers. Can also be used to exploit fall damage.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nMain DPS / Detonator: Prototype Archaic (F2P), Wolf's Gravestone, Skyward Pride, Blackcliff Slasher, Serpent Spine with 4P Crimson Witch or 2P Crimson Witch + 2P Gladiator's / Noblesse\n\n**HU TAO**\n\n|Constellation|Main DPS|Detonator|Enabler|Battery|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|C0|SS|SS|B+|B+|\n|C1|SS+|SS|B+|B+|\n|C2|SS+|SS+|A-|B+|\n|C4|SS+|SS+|A+|B+|\n|C6|SS+|SS+|A+|B+|\n\n\\- The Other Megumin\n\n\\- Initial value is great with her excellent basic attack and charged attack multipliers + Paramita Papilio infusion\n\n\\- Detonator potential greater than Diluc and c0-c5 Tartaglia.

        "Body/Content": "This is an extremely bizarre missing persons case which I\u2019m surprised hasn\u2019t been covered before on this sub. Unfortunately there is very little media coverage available freely online and the media coverage the case did receive was *exclusively* from the local newspaper. I discovered that I can essentially make the articles available if I paid for the [Newspapers.com](https://Newspapers.com) Publisher Edition and 'clipped' them (clipped articles are public). You should be able to click on the link and it will take you to a scan of the original news source but if this doesn't work please comment and let me know! \n\n**\"A sweet and lovable person\"** \n\nRobbin Lewis Slaughter was born to Dorothy \u2018Dot\u2019 Slaughter and William J. Slaughter in Owensboro, KY in the predominately black West End neighborhood. By all accounts, Slaughter\u2013\u2013who was 36-years-old at the time of his disappearance\u2013\u2013was a bit of a homebody. He kept his social circle small and rarely ventured outside the 5 or 6 places he frequented in town. [He didn\u2019t drive and usually got around town on foot](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56621171/police-call-off-second-search-of/)\u2013\u2013even his workplace was 1.3 miles (less than a 30-minute walk) from his home. [He didn\u2019t drink, gamble, or go out on the town.](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620570/familys-hoping-for-safe-return-of/) Slaughter\u2019s coworkers at the Owensboro Public Works Department described the 16-year-veteran clean-up crew member as a diligent and hard worker who was never late or missed a day of work. Rudd Slaughter, Robbin\u2019s older brother, was also employed by the department as a sanitation truck driver and the pair would sometimes work together.  \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good worker. He\u2019s very dependable,\u201d [said Cissy Gregson](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620540/familys-hoping-for-safe-return-of/), director of Owensboro\u2019s sanitation department. \u201cHe\u2019s easygoing. He wouldn\u2019t get in a confrontation with anybody.\u201d \n\nSlaughter was [extraordinarily close with his family](https://www.the-messenger.com/news/local/article_d60e2ec6-e767-11e4-b220-f7a4957ecdca.html). \u201cEven though he was grown, he lived with my mom until a couple of months before he was married,\u201d Slaughter\u2019s sister Kitty Board said. Dot even had power of attorney over her son\u2019s finances up until he married Lucinda. \n\n\u201cHe was a sweet and lovable person, but he needed looking after,\u201d Board said.\n\nRobbin Slaughter married his childhood friend Lucinda in 1991 after a whirlwind romance. The pair went out a few times when Lucinda was 15, although [the two didn\u2019t begin dating seriously until 12 years later](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620174/limbo-man-still-missing-pt-2/) when they reconnected at church. After Lucinda was critically injured in a car accident in 1990, Robbin visited her regularly during the two months she was in the hospital. Lucinda says Robbin\u2019s frequent visits convinced her of his caring nature and she started to see him as a potential father figure for her two daughters. \n\nRobbin\u2019s family was skeptical of his budding romance and felt the couple was moving too fast. Both Slaughter\u2019s brother and mother said [they noticed a change in his behavior after the marriage](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620570/familys-hoping-for-safe-return-of/). He used to like to listen to music and sports but \u201che cut back when he got married\u201d according to Rudd. \n\n\u201cHe changed,\u201d his brother recalled. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t come out as often. He settled down, just went to work and church.\u201d Slaughter\u2019s mother reported that after his marriage to Lucinda, he didn\u2019t visit as often (he used to visit her once a month). \n\nHis sister said that even after the marriage her family never accepted her brother\u2019s wife and stepdaughters, and that [there was a mutual agreement that \u201cwe don\u2019t question each other\u2019s lives.\"](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620570/familys-hoping-for-safe-return-of/) Lucinda herself readily admitted that Slaughter\u2019s family didn\u2019t get along with her, although [she claims that she reconciled with Slaughter\u2019s mother](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620174/limbo-man-still-missing-pt-2/) in the years following Robbin\u2019s disappearance. \n\nSlaughter was the polar opposite of someone who would run away to start a new life. \n\n\"He never went on any trips without family,\" said Slaughter's sister, Kitty Board. \u201cHe didn't stay away from home.... He never ventured out of his comfort zone. If you would say, 'Where's Robbin?' [there were five or six places he could be](https://www.the-messenger.com/news/local/article_d60e2ec6-e767-11e4-b220-f7a4957ecdca.html).\"\n\n**Timeline \u2013\u2013 (**[Google Map of important locations](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1-xDqnP7n-ruWsvsfyURzwCKgaYmJrXoa&usp=sharing)**)**\n\nWhen Slaughter vanished on the evening of Saturday, November 14, 1993 it was a shock. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019d not been out of state and very seldom out of town,\u201d [Board said](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620570/familys-hoping-for-safe-return-of/). \u201cHe\u2019s not the type of person who would plan to leave.\u201d\n\nSlaughter\u2019s wife Lucinda told police that that evening, at around 9pm, her husband left their home at 2714 West 10th Street to walk to Franey\u2019s Food Mart which was a trip he made frequently. It was an unseasonably warm day for mid-November, with a high near 75 degrees. At night, however, the temperature dropped as a line of evening thunderstorms moved through the area so Slaughter chose to put his gray and blue sweater on over his athletic shirt. He was also wearing a pair of blue jeans and white tennis shoes.  \n\nLucinda said that [Slaughter let her know that he would be back in around 40 to 45 minutes](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620503/police-looking-for-missing-36-year-old/). She told police that her husband was not distraught when he left the house and did not notice anything strange about his behavior. \n\nThe convenience store was less than a 15-minute walk from Slaughter\u2019s home so it made a perfect destination for an evening walk. Of the two possible routes he could have taken, both went through quiet, tree-lined streets dotted with small single-family homes. Franey\u2019s is located at the intersection of Cravens Avenue and Carter Road on the far west end of town. The southwest corner of this intersection marks the beginning of a vast expanse of farmland and open fields. On this night, however, Slaughter never made it inside the store.\n\nThe next morning at around 9 or 9:30am Lucinda Slaughter knocked on Board\u2019s door, inquiring as to whether Board had seen her brother. When Board said that she hadn\u2019t, Slaughter reported her husband missing. \n\nBeing a small, locally-owned chain, [the cashier at Franey\u2019s was familiar with Slaughter](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620570/familys-hoping-for-safe-return-of/) as he was a regular customer. Connie Carlisle, the cashier working on the night of Slaughter\u2019s disappearance, told police that ***Slaughter never entered the store that evening***, something which a review of surveillance footage from inside the store confirmed. One witness placed him in the parking lot at Franey\u2019s but this report was never confirmed. \n\n\u201cA (teen-age) boy talked with him in the parking lot, but he (Slaughter) never came in,\u201d Carlisle later told a reporter. According to Carlisle, Slaughter and this boy \u201cwere friends.\u201d The police apparently talked to the teenager Slaughter was last seen with but the boy denied talking with Slaughter and said he had only seen him in the parking lot. \n\nHis mother and siblings quickly cast doubt on the idea that Slaughter chose to disappear\u2013\u2013he was extremely close with his family and would never abandon them. Sgt. Michael Walker of the Owensboro Police Department\u2019s criminal investigations bureau [concurred with the family\u2019s assessment](https://www.the-messenger.com/news/local/article_d60e2ec6-e767-11e4-b220-f7a4957ecdca.html), stating that \u201cthere were no extraordinary circumstances that stood out as to why he would fit the profile of someone who would want to get away from it all.\u201d The police did not find anything in Slaughter\u2019s background that indicated he had any reason to disappear. \n\n\"He had family here,\" [Sgt. Walker said](https://www.the-messenger.com/news/local/article_d60e2ec6-e767-11e4-b220-f7a4957ecdca.html). \"There were no significant issues he was facing that would prompt him to take off without a word to anyone.\"\n\nSlaughter did not have any financial troubles or known enemies that might have led him to abandon his quiet life in Owensboro. Both Lucinda and Slaughter\u2019s family said that he was happy in the marriage and that he cared deeply for his stepdaughters. \n\nEven if Slaughter wanted to leave Owensboro and start a new life elsewhere, he would need to either get a ride from someone or take public transportation because he didn\u2019t have a car. A year and a half before Slaughter\u2019s disappearance a new bus terminal opened at 1216 E. 2nd Street with daily service to Evansville and Henderson. The terminal is just over a 3 mile walk from the Franey\u2019s Food Mart where Slaughter was last seen and would take him roughly an hour to travel there on foot. Besides, a number of Slaughter\u2019s relatives lived close by. \n\nAt the same time, there was no evidence a crime had taken place. Yet police see no other possibility aside from foul play. \n\n**\u201cThey should have done this years ago\u201d: Investigating (and excluding) Lucinda as a suspect**\n\nThe police investigation quickly hit a dead end in 1993, which is perhaps partially due to a number of problems impacting the department. Chief Ulysses Embry, a 40-year veteran of the Owensboro Police Department, retired in May of 1992 and left the department in need of new leadership. Tensions between the Police Department and City Hall reached a fever pitch in 1993 when disgruntled patrol officers with the Fraternal Order of Police organized a Back the Blue campaign. The department had also recently hired a number of new officers, most of whom were young and inexperienced. \n\n\u201cThe police department has got some young boys,\u201d Embry told reporters in 1993. \u201cThese boys mean well, but they will learn that they have got the responsibility of their job.\u201d\n\nThe police were slow to investigate Slaughter's disappearance initially and none of the news reports mentions a search being conducted for him. The extent of the police investigation in 1993 appears to have consisted of two 'witness' interviews (the clerk and the teenage boy) and a review of surveillance footage from Franey's. It wasn't until 2002 that police are known to have conducted a physical search for Slaughter.  \n\nTwo searches of Lucinda Calhoun\u2019s (she remarried in the years following Robbin's disappearance) former property at 2714 W. 10th Street were conducted in 2002 and [a portion of the property was excavated](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56621192/police-call-off-second-search-of/) after cadaver dogs alerted to the location. A separate portion of the adjoining backyard of 2710 W. 10th Street, Lucinda's mother's house, was also excavated. Officers originally identified Lucinda as a possible suspect in the early weeks of Slaughter\u2019s disappearance [based on rumors](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620272/search-for-body-comes-up-empty-pt-1/) that she had harmed her husband.

Ken Bennett declined to disclose how authorities obtained the new information but said that \u201cit\u2019s more detailed \\[...\\] than the earlier rumors.\" Lucinda gave police permission to search and excavate the backyard, but on the second day of the search police returned with a search warrant for the home on the property because they expected to conduct a \u201cmuch more elaborate\u201d search. \n\n**\\[**[Photos of the search](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620272/search-for-body-comes-up-empty-pt-1/)**\\]**\n\nAuthorities dug two holes on Lucinda\u2019s property\u2013\u2013one 6-feet deep by 10-feet wide portion was excavated along the back fence with a second 3-feet deep by 3-feet wide excavation site in the center of the backyard. Before dawn on the second day of the search, [detectives used Luminol inside the home to search for blood](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56621192/police-call-off-second-search-of/) and seized a handful of items\u2013\u2013including a door\u2013\u2013for additional testing. \n\n\u201cThey said they would do this quietly, and they\u2019re here at church time,\u201d Lucinda told reporters during the search. \u201cThey should have done this nine years ago.\u201d \n\nAfter the searches of Lucinda\u2019s property came up empty in 2002, police officially classified Slaughter\u2019s disappearance as a cold case. Lt. Bennett told the media at the time that [the case would remain cold](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56621122/woman-police-causing-heartaches-and/) until new information surfaces. In the meantime, Lt. Bennett said that the Owensboro Police would continue to treat Slaughter\u2019s disappearance as a noncriminal missing person case. \n\nLucinda accused the police of harassment, claiming that they unfairly targeted her as a suspect in her husband\u2019s disappearance. Members of the St. Louis-based Universal African People\u2019s Organization [joined Lucinda\u2019s family and friends in gathering in front of Lucinda\u2019s former home](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620357/st-louis-group-extends-support-in/) to provide moral support and call attention to what they described as \"police harassment.\" Representatives of the group later met with Mayor Waymond Morris and Owensboro Police Chief John Kazlauskas. \n\nMorris told the media that he had a \u201cvery cordial conversation\u201d with the group, although [he dismissed the accusations of harassment as unfounded](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620381/st-louis-group-extends-support-in/). \n\n\u201cI just listened to what they said, and I told them I\u2019d look into it,\u201d Morris recalled. \u201cThey said they wanted me to look into possible harassment. I think they feel like that maybe on several different occasions the police department has been overaggressive in searching.\u201d \n\nPolice excluded Lucinda as a suspect in her husband's disappearance after the search in 2002. She has always maintained her innocence and continues to search for answers in his case. \n\n**Racism**\n\nWhile researching this case, I came across an online forum page for Owensboro where residents apparently discuss community issues (in reality it seems to be used to gossip/harass people). One of the posts, created a month ago, concerns Robbin\u2019s nephew who still lives in the town and reads:\n\n>\u201cI wonder if that loud mouth n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* still works at Hunter Douglas, I quit because I got sick of listening to his loud mouth, he is one worthless n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*!!!\u201d\n\nObviously this is an anonymous comment posted online so it has to be taken with a grain of salt but the fact that the poster uses the n-word (which appears uncensored in the original post) is noteworthy. While Robbin\u2019s social circle was small, the Slaughter family was well-known in Owensboro. Kitty Board was (and still is) heavily involved in the West End community and openly spoke out against the gun violence plaguing the neighborhood. In fact, Board was quoted extensively in the local newspaper four months prior to her brother's disappearance in an article about illegal firearms. \n\nThe Owensboro police have also been accused of racial profiling and police brutality. The town has quite the storied legacy when it comes to questionable law enforcement tactics. In 1968, after a young black man named Jerry Brown was shot and killed at a local white-owned nightclub, protests broke out in \u201cthe Negro West End\u201d of the city. 20 people were arrested. Then Mayor Irvin Terrill pledged to \u201cdissolve the militant influence\u201d which he claimed was behind the violent outbreak, namely, the \u201cNegro gangs.\u201d Police Chief Vernie Bidwell doubled down on the mayor\u2019s threat, warning that the police were \u201ctired\u201d of being cursed by \u201cyoung punks\u201d and would crack down. \n\nMayor Waymond Morris came under fire in 2000 for his lackluster response to protests over the fatal shooting of Tyrone Clayton Jr. Clayton was shot twice by Owensboro Police Officer Lorhn Frazier after he was pulled over for reckless driving. The Mayor sent a letter to NAACP attorney Evan Taylor to inform the group that he would no longer be meeting with them at city hall. \n\n**Accidental death?**\n\nThere are hundreds of acres of farmland just 100 feet from the convenience store which one could ostensibly get lost in easily especially at night. The issue with this theory is that Slaughter disappeared in mid-November, which is [after fall planting season](https://simpson.ca.uky.edu/files/corn_and_soybean_production_calendar.pdf). The fact that the field would have been recently plowed coupled with the flat terrain of the area would make it exceedingly difficult for someone to get lost. \n\nSatellite images show a small retention pond on this nearby farm located roughly 730 feet from intersection near Franey\u2019s which could most easily be reached by walking parallel to the rear of the houses on Carter Road. The pond is bound by fields on three sides so it is possible that Slaughter wasn\u2019t able to see it if he was walking in the dark. From what I was able to find out, the catch basin was created in 1987 by the local government to reduce flash flooding on Carter Road, so it would have been there at the time of Slaughter\u2019s disappearance.\n\nMost retention ponds have a [depth of 4-6 feet](https://www.clemson.edu/extension/water/stormwater-ponds/problem-solving/construct-repair-dredge/index.html) so if the water level was high, Slaughter (who was 5\u2019 7\u201d) may not have been able to stand. If Slaughter didn\u2019t know how to swim, it\u2019s possible that he fell in and struggled to get his bearings on the thick layer of sediment on the bottom of the pond and drowned. Since his lungs would have filled with water, his body would have sunk to the bottom of the pond and subsequently covered by sediment. Retention ponds are typically dredged [every 5-10 years](https://clermontswcd.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2016/08/clermontswcdbasinmanual.pdf), however, so if Slaughter\u2019s body was there, I would assume that some of his remains would have been discovered. Also, because the retention pond appears to be owned by the city itself, they presumably would be able to search it without a warrant. \n\n**Questions**\n\nI honestly have nothing but questions about this case. \n\n1. Did police ever search the area around Franey's food mart? From what I can tell, they only searched Lucinda's property. If they didn't search the area\u2013\u2013why not? Did the police take the case seriously from the beginning?\n2. Given the fact that Slaughter's mother had power of attorney over his finances until he was in his 30s and he didn't drive, it seems highly unlikely that he could have disappeared on his own (although he has no motive to run away). The only scenario in which a voluntary disappearance makes sense to me is if Slaughter met someone and the two planned on starting a new life together somewhere else. But who? \n3. As far as I know, Lucinda was eliminated as a suspect after the searches in 2002 leaving the police with zero other leads. Was this a random crime of opportunity and Slaughter just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time? Could he have seen something he shouldn't have and been kidnapped and killed in retaliation? \n\nThere are no unidentified persons on NAMUS matching Slaughter's description except [one](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/1997/details?nav). In 1999, a furnace installer in Cleveland was attempting to clear a blockage in the chimney when he discovered what appeared to be human remains. The partial remains were later identified as those of a black male, age 37-47 (Slaughter disappeared nine days before his 37th birthday), who died \"by violence of undetermined origin.\" The unidentified man was 5'7\" (same height) and had died sometime between 1900 and 1999. \n\n[**Here**](https://imgur.com/gallery/opS96bo) **is a side-by-side comparison of the two.**\n\nThe only things that don't line up are the location and the clothing found on the body. John Doe was found in a chimney in Cleveland, OH\u2013\u2013a 7-hour drive from Owensboro, KY. Slaughter didn't drive and he had never left the state so if this were him, he must have been taken to Cleveland alive and then killed at some point (but why drive someone 7 hours away?). John Doe's clothing also doesn't match the description of when Slaughter was last seen, although if he was taken so far away he might have changed clothes. \n\n**EDIT: Thanks so much everyone for taking the time to read about this case and for kind words\u2013\u2013Robbin's disappearance is very confusing and troubling (as well as basically unreported outside of Owensboro) so I'm happy that more people can learn about his story!**\n\n**EDIT 2: I submitted Robbin as a potential match for the Cleveland John Doe and will post an update if I hear back.**\n\n**EDIT 3 (11/3): The NAMUS regional program officer just responded to my submission of a potential match and it has been forwarded to both investigating agencies for future DNA comparison of Robbin and the Cleveland John Doe.**\n\n**Sources**\n\nJoy Campbell, \u201cSearch for body comes up empty: Police follow up on new information in 9-year-old case of missing man,\u201d *Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer*, September 9, 2002, pg. 1-2A. **\\[**[**part 1**](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620272/search-for-body-comes-up-empty-pt-1/)**,** [**part 2**](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620314/search-for-body-comes-up-empty-pt-2/)**\\]**\n\nMatthew Francis, \u201c[Protest by civil rights activists will not be heard by city officials](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56727156/protest-by-civil-rights-activists-will/),\u201d *Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer*, November 30, 2000, pg. 3.\n\nDan Heckel, \u201cCase leaves family in limbo: Probe of man\u2019s 1993 disappearance has gone nowhere,\u201d *Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer*, November 17, 1996, pg. 1-2A. **\\[**[**part 1**](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620190/limbo-man-still-missing-pt-1/)**,** [**part 2**](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620174/limbo-man-still-missing-pt-2/)**\\]**\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013   \u201cFamily\u2019s hoping for safe return of missing man,\u201d *Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer*, February 14, 1994, pg. 1-2A. **\\[**[**part 1**](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620540/familys-hoping-for-safe-return-of/)**,** [**part 2**](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620570/familys-hoping-for-safe-return-of/)**\\]**\n\nStewart Jennison, \u201cBuses coming to town: Daily trips will link Owensboro with Evansville,\u201d *Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer*, May 16, 1992, pg. 9.\n\nJames Mayse, \u201c[Unfinished Business](https://www.the-messenger.com/news/local/article_d60e2ec6-e767-11e4-b220-f7a4957ecdca.html),\u201d *Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer*, April 20, 2015, pg.

        "Body/Content": "Hi everyone! I was inspired by u/TheBonesofAutumn to post an update on Robbin Lewis Slaughter's case (original post included below) which I did a write-up on a few months ago. I  had identified a set of remains from a male homicide victim found in a chimney in Cleveland as a potential match for Robbin and submitted the match to NAMUS for consideration. A few days ago, I received [an email](https://imgur.com/Nt2wy1h) from the program officer letting me know that he will be forwarding the match to both law enforcement agencies for a potential DNA comparison! \n\nAlso, I am currently working on an *extensive* write-up of the case of Toni Danieelle Clark which has been nearly 3 years in the making (I've interviewed her family and friends as well as the law enforcement officers originally assigned to her case over the past few months in addition to FOIA requests) so stay tuned! My goal is to submit it to a newspaper as a long-form investigative journalism piece but I will post it on here regardless (totally a shot in the dark, but if anyone here has experience pitching articles, I'd love to speak with you!).\n\n**\"A sweet and lovable person\"**\n\nRobbin Lewis Slaughter was born to Dorothy \u2018Dot\u2019 Slaughter and William J. Slaughter in Owensboro, KY in the predominately black West End neighborhood. By all accounts, Slaughter\u2013\u2013who was 36-years-old at the time of his disappearance\u2013\u2013was a bit of a homebody. He kept his social circle small and rarely ventured outside the 5 or 6 places he frequented in town. [He didn\u2019t drive and usually got around town on foot](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56621171/police-call-off-second-search-of/)\u2013\u2013even his workplace was 1.3 miles (less than a 30-minute walk) from his home. [He didn\u2019t drink, gamble, or go out on the town.](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620570/familys-hoping-for-safe-return-of/) Slaughter\u2019s coworkers at the Owensboro Public Works Department described the 16-year-veteran clean-up crew member as a diligent and hard worker who was never late or missed a day of work. Rudd Slaughter, Robbin\u2019s older brother, was also employed by the department as a sanitation truck driver and the pair would sometimes work together.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good worker. He\u2019s very dependable,\u201d [said Cissy Gregson](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620540/familys-hoping-for-safe-return-of/), director of Owensboro\u2019s sanitation department. \u201cHe\u2019s easygoing. He wouldn\u2019t get in a confrontation with anybody.\u201d\n\nSlaughter was [extraordinarily close with his family](https://www.the-messenger.com/news/local/article_d60e2ec6-e767-11e4-b220-f7a4957ecdca.html). \u201cEven though he was grown, he lived with my mom until a couple of months before he was married,\u201d Slaughter\u2019s sister Kitty Board said. Dot even had power of attorney over her son\u2019s finances up until he married Lucinda.\n\n\u201cHe was a sweet and lovable person, but he needed looking after,\u201d Board said.\n\nRobbin Slaughter married his childhood friend Lucinda in 1991 after a whirlwind romance. The pair went out a few times when Lucinda was 15, although [the two didn\u2019t begin dating seriously until 12 years later](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620174/limbo-man-still-missing-pt-2/) when they reconnected at church. After Lucinda was critically injured in a car accident in 1990, Robbin visited her regularly during the two months she was in the hospital. Lucinda says Robbin\u2019s frequent visits convinced her of his caring nature and she started to see him as a potential father figure for her two daughters.\n\nRobbin\u2019s family was skeptical of his budding romance and felt the couple was moving too fast. Both Slaughter\u2019s brother and mother said [they noticed a change in his behavior after the marriage](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620570/familys-hoping-for-safe-return-of/). He used to like to listen to music and sports but \u201che cut back when he got married\u201d according to Rudd.\n\n\u201cHe changed,\u201d his brother recalled. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t come out as often. He settled down, just went to work and church.\u201d Slaughter\u2019s mother reported that after his marriage to Lucinda, he didn\u2019t visit as often (he used to visit her once a month).\n\nHis sister said that even after the marriage her family never accepted her brother\u2019s wife and stepdaughters, and that [there was a mutual agreement that \u201cwe don\u2019t question each other\u2019s lives.\"](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620570/familys-hoping-for-safe-return-of/) Lucinda herself readily admitted that Slaughter\u2019s family didn\u2019t get along with her, although [she claims that she reconciled with Slaughter\u2019s mother](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620174/limbo-man-still-missing-pt-2/) in the years following Robbin\u2019s disappearance.\n\nSlaughter was the polar opposite of someone who would run away to start a new life.\n\n\"He never went on any trips without family,\" said Slaughter's sister, Kitty Board. \u201cHe didn't stay away from home.... He never ventured out of his comfort zone. If you would say, 'Where's Robbin?' [there were five or six places he could be](https://www.the-messenger.com/news/local/article_d60e2ec6-e767-11e4-b220-f7a4957ecdca.html).\"\n\n**Timeline \u2013\u2013 (**[Google Map of important locations](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1-xDqnP7n-ruWsvsfyURzwCKgaYmJrXoa&usp=sharing)**)**\n\nWhen Slaughter vanished on the evening of Saturday, November 14, 1993 it was a shock.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d not been out of state and very seldom out of town,\u201d [Board said](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620570/familys-hoping-for-safe-return-of/). \u201cHe\u2019s not the type of person who would plan to leave.\u201d\n\nSlaughter\u2019s wife Lucinda told police that that evening, at around 9pm, her husband left their home at 2714 West 10th Street to walk to Franey\u2019s Food Mart which was a trip he made frequently. It was an unseasonably warm day for mid-November, with a high near 75 degrees. At night, however, the temperature dropped as a line of evening thunderstorms moved through the area so Slaughter chose to put his gray and blue sweater on over his athletic shirt. He was also wearing a pair of blue jeans and white tennis shoes.\n\nLucinda said that [Slaughter let her know that he would be back in around 40 to 45 minutes](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620503/police-looking-for-missing-36-year-old/). She told police that her husband was not distraught when he left the house and did not notice anything strange about his behavior.\n\nThe convenience store was less than a 15-minute walk from Slaughter\u2019s home so it made a perfect destination for an evening walk. Of the two possible routes he could have taken, both went through quiet, tree-lined streets dotted with small single-family homes. Franey\u2019s is located at the intersection of Cravens Avenue and Carter Road on the far west end of town. The southwest corner of this intersection marks the beginning of a vast expanse of farmland and open fields. On this night, however, Slaughter never made it inside the store.\n\nThe next morning at around 9 or 9:30am Lucinda Slaughter knocked on Board\u2019s door, inquiring as to whether Board had seen her brother. When Board said that she hadn\u2019t, Slaughter reported her husband missing.\n\nBeing a small, locally-owned chain, [the cashier at Franey\u2019s was familiar with Slaughter](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620570/familys-hoping-for-safe-return-of/) as he was a regular customer. Connie Carlisle, the cashier working on the night of Slaughter\u2019s disappearance, told police that ***Slaughter never entered the store that evening***, something which a review of surveillance footage from inside the store confirmed. One witness placed him in the parking lot at Franey\u2019s but this report was never confirmed.\n\n\u201cA (teen-age) boy talked with him in the parking lot, but he (Slaughter) never came in,\u201d Carlisle later told a reporter. According to Carlisle, Slaughter and this boy \u201cwere friends.\u201d The police apparently talked to the teenager Slaughter was last seen with but the boy denied talking with Slaughter and said he had only seen him in the parking lot.\n\nHis mother and siblings quickly cast doubt on the idea that Slaughter chose to disappear\u2013\u2013he was extremely close with his family and would never abandon them. Sgt. Michael Walker of the Owensboro Police Department\u2019s criminal investigations bureau [concurred with the family\u2019s assessment](https://www.the-messenger.com/news/local/article_d60e2ec6-e767-11e4-b220-f7a4957ecdca.html), stating that \u201cthere were no extraordinary circumstances that stood out as to why he would fit the profile of someone who would want to get away from it all.\u201d The police did not find anything in Slaughter\u2019s background that indicated he had any reason to disappear.\n\n\"He had family here,\" [Sgt. Walker said](https://www.the-messenger.com/news/local/article_d60e2ec6-e767-11e4-b220-f7a4957ecdca.html). \"There were no significant issues he was facing that would prompt him to take off without a word to anyone.\"\n\nSlaughter did not have any financial troubles or known enemies that might have led him to abandon his quiet life in Owensboro. Both Lucinda and Slaughter\u2019s family said that he was happy in the marriage and that he cared deeply for his stepdaughters.\n\nEven if Slaughter wanted to leave Owensboro and start a new life elsewhere, he would need to either get a ride from someone or take public transportation because he didn\u2019t have a car. A year and a half before Slaughter\u2019s disappearance a new bus terminal opened at 1216 E. 2nd Street with daily service to Evansville and Henderson. The terminal is just over a 3 mile walk from the Franey\u2019s Food Mart where Slaughter was last seen and would take him roughly an hour to travel there on foot. Besides, a number of Slaughter\u2019s relatives lived close by.\n\nAt the same time, there was no evidence a crime had taken place. Yet police see no other possibility aside from foul play.\n\n**\u201cThey should have done this years ago\u201d: Investigating (and excluding) Lucinda as a suspect**\n\nThe police investigation quickly hit a dead end in 1993, which is perhaps partially due to a number of problems impacting the department. Chief Ulysses Embry, a 40-year veteran of the Owensboro Police Department, retired in May of 1992 and left the department in need of new leadership. Tensions between the Police Department and City Hall reached a fever pitch in 1993 when disgruntled patrol officers with the Fraternal Order of Police organized a Back the Blue campaign. The department had also recently hired a number of new officers, most of whom were young and inexperienced.\n\n\u201cThe police department has got some young boys,\u201d Embry told reporters in 1993. \u201cThese boys mean well, but they will learn that they have got the responsibility of their job.\u201d\n\nThe police were slow to investigate Slaughter's disappearance initially and none of the news reports mentions a search being conducted for him. The extent of the police investigation in 1993 appears to have consisted of two 'witness' interviews (the clerk and the teenage boy) and a review of surveillance footage from Franey's. It wasn't until 2002 that police are known to have conducted a physical search for Slaughter.\n\nTwo searches of Lucinda Calhoun\u2019s (she remarried in the years following Robbin's disappearance) former property at 2714 W. 10th Street were conducted in 2002 and [a portion of the property was excavated](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56621192/police-call-off-second-search-of/) after cadaver dogs alerted to the location. A separate portion of the adjoining backyard of 2710 W. 10th Street, Lucinda's mother's house, was also excavated. Officers originally identified Lucinda as a possible suspect in the early weeks of Slaughter\u2019s disappearance [based on rumors](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620272/search-for-body-comes-up-empty-pt-1/) that she had harmed her husband. Lt. Ken Bennett declined to disclose how authorities obtained the new information but said that \u201cit\u2019s more detailed \\[...\\] than the earlier rumors.\" Lucinda gave police permission to search and excavate the backyard, but on the second day of the search police returned with a search warrant for the home on the property because they expected to conduct a \u201cmuch more elaborate\u201d search.\n\n**\\[**[Photos of the search](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620272/search-for-body-comes-up-empty-pt-1/)**\\]**\n\nAuthorities dug two holes on Lucinda\u2019s property\u2013\u2013one 6-feet deep by 10-feet wide portion was excavated along the back fence with a second 3-feet deep by 3-feet wide excavation site in the center of the backyard. Before dawn on the second day of the search, [detectives used Luminol inside the home to search for blood](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56621192/police-call-off-second-search-of/) and seized a handful of items\u2013\u2013including a door\u2013\u2013for additional testing.\n\n\u201cThey said they would do this quietly, and they\u2019re here at church time,\u201d Lucinda told reporters during the search. \u201cThey should have done this nine years ago.\u201d\n\nAfter the searches of Lucinda\u2019s property came up empty in 2002, police officially classified Slaughter\u2019s disappearance as a cold case. Lt. Bennett told the media at the time that [the case would remain cold](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56621122/woman-police-causing-heartaches-and/) until new information surfaces. In the meantime, Lt. Bennett said that the Owensboro Police would continue to treat Slaughter\u2019s disappearance as a noncriminal missing person case.\n\nLucinda accused the police of harassment, claiming that they unfairly targeted her as a suspect in her husband\u2019s disappearance. Members of the St. Louis-based Universal African People\u2019s Organization [joined Lucinda\u2019s family and friends in gathering in front of Lucinda\u2019s former home](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620357/st-louis-group-extends-support-in/) to provide moral support and call attention to what they described as \"police harassment.\" Representatives of the group later met with Mayor Waymond Morris and Owensboro Police Chief John Kazlauskas.\n\nMorris told the media that he had a \u201cvery cordial conversation\u201d with the group, although [he dismissed the accusations of harassment as unfounded](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620381/st-louis-group-extends-support-in/).\n\n\u201cI just listened to what they said, and I told them I\u2019d look into it,\u201d Morris recalled. \u201cThey said they wanted me to look into possible harassment. I think they feel like that maybe on several different occasions the police department has been overaggressive in searching.\u201d\n\nPolice excluded Lucinda as a suspect in her husband's disappearance after the search in 2002. She has always maintained her innocence and continues to search for answers in his case.\n\n**Racism**\n\nWhile researching this case, I came across an online forum page for Owensboro where residents apparently discuss community issues (in reality it seems to be used to gossip/harass people). One of the posts, created a month ago, concerns Robbin\u2019s nephew who still lives in the town and reads:\n\n>\u201cI wonder if that loud mouth n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* still works at Hunter Douglas, I quit because I got sick of listening to his loud mouth, he is one worthless n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*!!!\u201d\n\nObviously this is an anonymous comment posted online so it has to be taken with a grain of salt but the fact that the poster uses the n-word (which appears uncensored in the original post) is noteworthy. While Robbin\u2019s social circle was small, the Slaughter family was well-known in Owensboro. Kitty Board was (and still is) heavily involved in the West End community and openly spoke out against the gun violence plaguing the neighborhood. In fact, Board was quoted extensively in the local newspaper four months prior to her brother's disappearance in an article about illegal firearms.\n\nThe Owensboro police have also been accused of racial profiling and police brutality. The town has quite the storied legacy when it comes to questionable law enforcement tactics. In 1968, after a young black man named Jerry Brown was shot and killed at a local white-owned nightclub, protests broke out in \u201cthe Negro West End\u201d of the city. 20 people were arrested. Then Mayor Irvin Terrill pledged to \u201cdissolve the militant influence\u201d which he claimed was behind the violent outbreak, namely, the \u201cNegro gangs.\u201d Police Chief Vernie Bidwell doubled down on the mayor\u2019s threat, warning that the police were \u201ctired\u201d of being cursed by \u201cyoung punks\u201d and would crack down.\n\nMayor Waymond Morris came under fire in 2000 for his lackluster response to protests over the fatal shooting of Tyrone Clayton Jr. Clayton was shot twice by Owensboro Police Officer Lorhn Frazier after he was pulled over for reckless driving. The Mayor sent a letter to NAACP attorney Evan Taylor to inform the group that he would no longer be meeting with them at city hall.\n\n**Accidental death?**\n\nThere are hundreds of acres of farmland just 100 feet from the convenience store which one could ostensibly get lost in easily especially at night. The issue with this theory is that Slaughter disappeared in mid-November, which is [after fall planting season](https://simpson.ca.uky.edu/files/corn_and_soybean_production_calendar.pdf). The fact that the field would have been recently plowed coupled with the flat terrain of the area would make it exceedingly difficult for someone to get lost.\n\nSatellite images show a small retention pond on this nearby farm located roughly 730 feet from intersection near Franey\u2019s which could most easily be reached by walking parallel to the rear of the houses on Carter Road. The pond is bound by fields on three sides so it is possible that Slaughter wasn\u2019t able to see it if he was walking in the dark. From what I was able to find out, the catch basin was created in 1987 by the local government to reduce flash flooding on Carter Road, so it would have been there at the time of Slaughter\u2019s disappearance.\n\nMost retention ponds have a [depth of 4-6 feet](https://www.clemson.edu/extension/water/stormwater-ponds/problem-solving/construct-repair-dredge/index.html) so if the water level was high, Slaughter (who was 5\u2019 7\u201d) may not have been able to stand. If Slaughter didn\u2019t know how to swim, it\u2019s possible that he fell in and struggled to get his bearings on the thick layer of sediment on the bottom of the pond and drowned. Since his lungs would have filled with water, his body would have sunk to the bottom of the pond and subsequently covered by sediment. Retention ponds are typically dredged [every 5-10 years](https://clermontswcd.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2016/08/clermontswcdbasinmanual.pdf), however, so if Slaughter\u2019s body was there, I would assume that some of his remains would have been discovered. Also, because the retention pond appears to be owned by the city itself, they presumably would be able to search it without a warrant.\n\n**Questions**\n\nI honestly have nothing but questions about this case.\n\n1. Did police ever search the area around Franey's food mart? From what I can tell, they only searched Lucinda's property. If they didn't search the area\u2013\u2013why not? Did the police take the case seriously from the beginning?\n2. Given the fact that Slaughter's mother had power of attorney over his finances until he was in his 30s and he didn't drive, it seems highly unlikely that he could have disappeared on his own (although he has no motive to run away). The only scenario in which a voluntary disappearance makes sense to me is if Slaughter met someone and the two planned on starting a new life together somewhere else. But who?\n3. As far as I know, Lucinda was eliminated as a suspect after the searches in 2002 leaving the police with zero other leads. Was this a random crime of opportunity and Slaughter just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time? Could he have seen something he shouldn't have and been kidnapped and killed in retaliation?\n\nThere are no unidentified persons on NAMUS matching Slaughter's description except [one](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/1997/details?nav). In 1999, a furnace installer in Cleveland was attempting to clear a blockage in the chimney when he discovered what appeared to be human remains. The partial remains were later identified as those of a black male, age 37-47 (Slaughter disappeared nine days before his 37th birthday), who died \"by violence of undetermined origin.\" The unidentified man was 5'7\" (same height) and had died sometime between 1900 and 1999.\n\n[**Here**](https://imgur.com/gallery/opS96bo) **is a side-by-side comparison of the two.**\n\nThe only things that don't line up are the location and the clothing found on the body. John Doe was found in a chimney in Cleveland, OH\u2013\u2013a 7-hour drive from Owensboro, KY. Slaughter didn't drive and he had never left the state so if this were him, he must have been taken to Cleveland alive and then killed at some point (but why drive someone 7 hours away?). John Doe's clothing also doesn't match the description of when Slaughter was last seen, although if he was taken so far away he might have changed clothes.\n\n**EDIT: Thanks so much everyone for taking the time to read about this case and for kind words\u2013\u2013Robbin's disappearance is very confusing and troubling (as well as basically unreported outside of Owensboro) so I'm happy that more people can learn about his story!**\n\n**EDIT 2: I submitted Robbin as a potential match for the Cleveland John Doe and will post an update if I hear back.**\n\n**EDIT 3 (11/3): The NAMUS regional program officer just responded to my submission of a potential match and it has been forwarded to both investigating agencies for future DNA comparison of Robbin and the Cleveland John Doe.**\n\n**Sources**\n\nJoy Campbell, \u201cSearch for body comes up empty: Police follow up on new information in 9-year-old case of missing man,\u201d *Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer*, September 9, 2002, pg. 1-2A. **\\[**[**part 1**](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620272/search-for-body-comes-up-empty-pt-1/)**,** [**part 2**](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620314/search-for-body-comes-up-empty-pt-2/)**\\]**\n\nMatthew Francis, \u201c[Protest by civil rights activists will not be heard by city officials](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56727156/protest-by-civil-rights-activists-will/),\u201d *Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer*, November 30, 2000, pg. 3.\n\nDan Heckel, \u201cCase leaves family in limbo: Probe of man\u2019s 1993 disappearance has gone nowhere,\u201d *Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer*, November 17, 1996, pg. 1-2A. **\\[**[**part 1**](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620190/limbo-man-still-missing-pt-1/)**,** [**part 2**](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620174/limbo-man-still-missing-pt-2/)**\\]**\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u201cFamily\u2019s hoping for safe return of missing man,\u201d *Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer*, February 14, 1994, pg. 1-2A. **\\[**[**part 1**](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620540/familys-hoping-for-safe-return-of/)**,** [**part 2**](https://www.newspapers.com/clip/56620570/familys-hoping-for-safe-return-of/)**\\]**\n\nStewart Jennison, \u201cBuses coming to town: Daily trips will link Owensboro with Evansville,\u201d *Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer*, May 16, 1992, pg. 9.\n\nJames Mayse, \u201c[Unfinished Business](https://www.the-messenger.com/news/local/article_d60e2ec6-e767-11e4-b220-f7a4957ecdca.html),\u201d *Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer*, April 20, 2015, pg.

        "Title": "I saw 270 movies in theaters in 2022. Here is my full ranking.",
        "Body/Content": "Every year since 2015, I've been going to the movie theater as much as possible, keeping track of every movie I see (along with ticket stubs, scores, some thoughts, etc). I went 5 times in 2015, 9 times in 2016, 146 times in 2017, 165 times in 2018, 193 times in 2019, 45 times in 2020, 86 times in 2021, and 273 times in 2022. I rarely go watch a movie more than once, but it happens a few times a year. I try to go 3-5 times per week, depending on what's coming out. I have 25 or so theaters within 15 miles so I get a solid selection every week, everything from big blockbusters to obscure, one-theater-only international releases. I'm not big into horror so many notable ones will be missing from my ranking (*Halloween Ends*, *Smile*, *Orphan: First Kill*, *Terrifier 2*, *Prey for the Devil*, *Jeepers Creepers Reborn*, etc). With A-list, festival memberships/passes, reward points, matinee screenings, Discount Tuesdays, etc, I'd guess it probably averages out to only about $6-$8 or so per movie. I go alone most of the time. \n\nI set a goal in January 2020 to go see 200 different movies in theaters that year (after doing 192 in 2019), but had to abandon that in mid-March (after 44 movies) and didn't go again for the next 13 months because of COVID, then slowly started going back in late-March 2021. This year was a bit like making up for lost time in 2020/2021.\n\nAfter ever only having been to 1 ever before, I also went to 5 film festivals this year: Savannah Film Festival (15 movies in 3 days), Miami Film Festival (16 movies in 7 days), Outshine Film Festival (6 movies in 5 days), Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival (11 movies in 6 days), and the Gems Miami Film Festival (5 movies in 2 days). For most of the festival screenings, members of the cast/crew were present for the movie and Q&As. Some highlights were Ron Howard after *Thirteen Lives*, Eddie Redmayne after *The Good Nurse*, Kerry Condon after *The Banshees of Inisherin*, Dean-Fleischer Camp after *Marcel the Shell with Shoes On*, Jeremy Pope after *The Inspection*, Eric Appel after *Weird: The Al Yankovic Story*, Jared Harris after *The Ghost of Richard Harris*, and Michael Ward after *Empire of Light*.\n\nI try to stay away from reviews/trailers/etc as much as possible before watching something, to go in as blindly as possible. My ranking/thoughts/scores are for fun, I am not a professional (or good) reviewer and this isn't meant to be taken super seriously. It's basically just an enjoyment ranking, based on a score I give to a movie right after watching it. It's not really meant to put movies against each other, and I don't have any sort of checklist/requirements/guideline for scores. I just like going to the movies and keeping score for fun. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**The Worst Person in the World** - 10/10 - *I haven't been this blown away by a duo of lead performances since Marriage Story. I love the way it was structured like a book, with important chapters of her life. Anyone that is struggling (or has struggled) getting their life together in their 20s will be able to form a strong bond with this movie. It's full of heartwarming and relatable and beautiful moments but always casting a strong existential shadow. On a technical level, it's one of the best directed and edited movies of the year. The surreal (and dream/trip) scenes could feel out of place in most other movies, but they're woven in perfectly here. Absolutely perfect bittersweet ending and Waters of March was a great match to go with it. Catchy and stuck in my head for a while. The kind of movie that just makes you melt into your seat as the credits roll. My favorite movie of the year.*\n\n**Aftersun** - 9/10\n\n**Petite Maman** - 9/10\n\n**Babylon** - 9/10 - *Voodoo Mama is the best original song of the year. Margot Robbie puts in the best performance of the year (with an amazing scene-stealing performance from PJ Byrne in the few minutes he's in it). 'For the love of Cinema' is basically its own genre now (especially this year with Empire of Light, The Fablemans, Last Film Show, etc) but this is the cream of the crop. Starts off at 120 MPH, doesn't let off the gas for an hour, then it slows down a bit (maybe too much...), only for it to take another batshit crazy turn. An amazing final scene. Damien Chazelle does not miss. The scene where Margot Robbie, Olivia Hamilton, and PJ Byrne try to make a scene work with the new sound coordinator is the most I've laughed in a while.*\n\n**Top Gun: Maverick** - 9/10 - *The best action blockbuster in a while. I can't add anything that already hasn't been said a million times before.*\n\n**All Quiet On the Western Front** - 9/10 - *Up there with Paths of Glory, Come and See, The Bridge with being one of the best anti-war movies of all time. It has some of the best production design for a war movie I've ever seen, really impressive stuff for a non-Hollywood production. Very brutal, very grounded.* \n\n**Licorice Pizza** - 9/10\n\n**CODA** - 9/10 - *The movie equivalent of a hot bowl of soup on a cold day. Soul-warming stuff. Reading the premise, you'd expect something really cheesy/tearjerky, but this gets around that and earns a bunch of real tears.*\n\n**Close** - 9/10 - *The bus scene was the single-most emotionally-impactful scene of the year. Heartbreaking tale of childhood innocence and the consequences of societal pressures.*\n\n**The Banshees of Inisherin** - 9/10\n\n**Triangle of Sadness** - 9/10 \n\n**A Chiara** - 9/10 - *A really unique and great mob movie. It doesn't concentrate so much on the mobsters, but the effect a criminal-empire has on the family of the boss. You're put in the shoes of the daughther of a mobster, and seeing her navigate and come to acceptance with her dad's situation made for a really thrilling movie.*\n\n**Marcel the Shell with Shoes On** - 9/10 - *You haven't lived until you're sitting a full theater of people laugh-crying about a tiny shell. I saw this in July, couldn't stop thinking about it, and went to see it again in October with the director (Dean Fleischer Camp) in attendance.*\n\n**Arsenault and Sons** - 9/10 - *This was a reallllly good crime-thriller. It's about a French Canadian family that owns a regular small-town garage but  are also involved in illegal off-season hunting and meat distribution. A close-knit spider web of crime that quickly unravels and crumbles. It reminded me a lot of Animal Kingdom. Great score that helps build tension throughout, amazing acting all round, with a great payoff at the end. The best French-Canadian movie since the Cannes double-premiere of You're Sleeping Nicole and Mommy in 2014.*\n\n**Weird: The Al Yankovic Story** - *9/10 -Seeing this in a huge, sold out, 1200-seat theater with a completely raucus and wild late-night crowd full of Weird Al fans was honestly the most fun experience I\u2019ve ever had at the movies. Something I'd pay a lot to experience again. Hilarious, perfectly-outrageous, but with a good amount of heart thrown in. Score is maybe inflated a bit based on how many drinks I had beforehand. Happy that Roku financed it in the first place, but still a bummer this won\u2019t get a theatrical release. I feel like it was strongly elevated by that.* \n\n**Stars at Noon** - 9/10 - *My only complaint is that it wrapped up so quickly. I wanted another hour. Claire Denis' best movie since 35 Shots of Rum. If someone asked me to suggest a movie that's flown completely under the radar this year, it'd be this one. It's full of great performances, geopolitical spy/thriller intrigue, and mystery.* \n\n**The Whale** - 9/10 - *Brendan Fraser is rightfully getting a lot of praise for this performance, but the whole cast deserves it. Hong Chau and Sadie Sink put in two of the best supporting performances of the year. Aronofsky's recent stuff might get too bogged down by religious allegory but this worked on many more levels.* \n\n**Novembre** - 9/10 - *A mix of Sicario and Zero Dark Thirty. An air-tight, real-life, crime-thriller that doesn't waste a single second and keeps your heart pounding throughout (especially that one raid scene near the end, holy shit).*\n\n**Holy Spider** - 9/10\n\n**The Ghost of Richard Harris** - 9/10 - *The best documentary of the year. A sweet and honest tribute by 3 sons for their legendary, complicated father. It doesn't shy away from the tough topics, and the interviews feel deeply-personal, more than most documentaries. It covers his faults and his greatness evenly, perfectly balanced. The Jim Sheridan segment is probably my all-time favorite documentary interview, totally honest and revalatory.*\n\n**Red Rocket** - 8/10 - *Pound-for-pound the funniest movie of the year and the best comedy since Don't Look Up.*\n\n**Avatar: The Way of Water** - 8/10\n\n**EO** - 8/10 - *On one hand, it made me lose all hope in humanity. On the other hand, it fully restored it. A delicate balance, and a beautiful little puzzle of a movie, and maybe the best overall score of the year.*\n\n**The Good Boss** - 8/10\n\n**The Batman** - 8/10\n\n**The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent** - 8/10\n\n**Ramona** - 8/10 - *Lourdes Gonz\u00e1lez is completely mesmerizing in this. One of my favorite performances of the year. A sweet, breezy, and quirky comedy-drama. The color/melodrama of Almodovar, the walk-and-talk romance of Linklater, and the aesthetic of Noah Baumbach, but a beautifully-personal and cute story that makes it stand on its own.*   \n\n**Gagarine** - 8/10 - *A beautiful and sad story of childhood imagination and loss. It's an extremely unique take on the coming-of-age/first love/early friendship genre. Super sweet. Lyna Khoudri is going to be huge, I think. Came out of nowhere and blew me away. George Washington is one of my favorite movies ever, and this reminded me a lot of that. There was something really comforting and innocent about it.*\n\n**Olga** - 8/10 - *Jaw-dropping performance for a first-time actress. Maybe the best debut performance in a while. Intertwined real-life footage doesn't work most of the time, but it was perfect in this movie. Amazing sound design, lightning (in the gyms especially), and use of non-actors. Imaginative transitions. Some sports movies can make 'big competition climax' seem corny and fake, but this was the opposite, it was a perfectly shot climax, like an Olympics documentary or something. The current situation in Ukraine adds a whole new parallel/layer to this already-amazing movie.*\n\n**Thirteen Lives** - 8/10 - *Formulaic but very effective. A bit too long, but still a great rescue/survival movie. If this doesn\u2019t win the Sound Design and/or Production Design Oscar, then I don\u2019t know why those awards exist.* \n\n**Emily the Criminal** - 8/10\n\n**Bodies Bodies Bodies** - 8/10 \n\n**En Corps** - 8/10 - *Beautifully choreographed and uplifting movie.*\n\n**Knives Out: Glass Onion** - 8/10\n\n**X** - 8/10\n\n**Everything Everywhere All At Once** - 8/10\n\n**Tar** - 8/10 - *I really wish this cut the last 10 minutes. For me, the perfect end point would have been when she's watching the old Leonard Bernstein VHS tape at her childhood home, but Cate Blanchett carries this to greatness.*\n\n**Puss in Boots: The Last Wish** - 8/10 - *Animated movies aren't really my thing, but this was a really fun and cute movie.*\n\n**A Hero** - 8/10\n\n**Crimes of the Future** - 8/10\n\n**Drunken Birds** - 8/10\n\n**Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness** - 8/10 \n\n**Spider-Man: No Way Home** - 8/10 - *A really fun time.*\n\n**Official Competition** - 8/10 - *A biting, meta, and sharp satirical-comedy set in the world of filmmaking. Maybe Pen\u00e9lope Cruz's best-ever performance.* \n\n**Italian Studies** - 8/10 \n\n**Happening** - 8/10 \n\n**The Northman** - 8/10\n\n**Huda's Salon** - 8/10 - *This came out of nowhere. A lot more brutal and graphic than I thought it would be.*\n\n**Elvis** - 8/10 - *Tom Hanks was miscast (it should've been Bill Camp),but I get that you need a big name in this. The first few minutes suck, but a fun ride after that.* \n\n**Nightmare Alley** - 8/10 \n\n**Cha Cha Real Smooth** - 8/10 - *Sweet, lighthearted, unique, and refreshing rom-com. I need one of these once in a while.*\n\n**The Menu** - 8/10\n\n**Alcarras** - 8/10 - *I love a movie that just blindly throws you head-first into a complicated, layered, and relatable family drama. There's a rich built-in history that you can slowly piece together. The grandpa was amazing. All of the children felt like their own pillars to the story. A stern-but-loving dad clumsily trying to keep it together against a changing tide. Really great stuff.*\n\n**Devotion** - 8/10\n\n**Honk for Jesus. Save Your Soul** - 8/10 - *One of these days, Sterling K. Brown is going to get the recognition he deserves with a big award nomination (like he should've gotten for Waves a few years ago). This was really solid religious satire. It's like a behind-the-scenes version of The Eyes of Tammy Faye.*\n\n**The Phantom of the Open** - 8/10 - *Liked this a lot more than I expected. \"If life is tea, she's my sugar\" is one of my favorite lines of the year. It does feel like Mark Rylance is always playing the same character though.*\n\n**Black Panther: Wakanda Forever** - 8/10\n\n**Fire of Love** - 8/10 \n\n**Paris, 13th District** - 8/10 \n\n**Brighton 4th** - 8/10\n\n**Montana Story** - 8/10 - *Both comforting and unsettling. A really low-key family drama that sticks with you. Haley Lu Richardson is easily one of my favorite actresses, she's great in this.*\n\n**The Fablemans** - 8/10\n\n**Drive My Car** - 8/10\n\n**Lost Illusions** - 8/10 - *A sprawling epic of early-1800s French publishing (as boring as that sound, it's really not, it's completely captivating and flies by) and a great story of ethics vs profits. I love that Xavier Dolan just randomly shows up in things.*\n\n**The Lost King** - 8/10 - *Surprisingly sweet story about finding the body of King Richard III. Some of the comedy with the ex-husband character doesn\u2019t land and feels really dated, but overall a solid modern biopic. I liked that they made King Richard a ghost-like character that followed her around, it might have been too generic of a biopic if they didn\u2019t do something like that.* \n\n**Corsage** - 8/10 \n\n**Blonde** - 8/10\n\n**The Inspection** - 8/10\n\n**She Said** - 8/10 -\n\n**The Five Devils** - 8/10 - That karaoke scene though. \n\n**You Can Live Forever** - 8/10 - *This reminded me a lot of 2018's Disobedience (starring Rachel McAdams and Rachel Weisz), it's a story of forbidden lesbian love story set in a small-knit, religion-controlled community, led by 2 great lead performances. Really good drama with an amazing soundtrack. Plus, I'm a sucker for any Quebec-based films so this gets extra points.*\n\n**One Fine Morning** - 8/10 - *It\u2019s hard to explain but there's always a comforting warmth to Mia Hansen Love\u2019s movies, and this was no exception. Heartbreaking and beautiful performance from Lea Seydoux.  Side note: Ending movies with a freeze frame is really corny and it never works, its a trend that should have stayed in the 80s or whereever.*\n\n**Matilda: The Musical** - 8/10\n\n**Sam Now** - 8/10 - *Very thoughtful documentary filmed over 25 years. 500+ hours of footage cut down to a journey of 86 minutes, about 2 half-brothers looking for the mother that abandoned them without explanation.*\n\n**Nope** - 7/10 \n\n**The Gray Man** - 7/10 - *Totally ridiculous, totally stupid, totally enjoyable. As far as Netflix's globe-trotting bloated action movies go (Red Notice, Six Underground), this is by far the best. I know that's not a high bar, but this had that '90s blank check action movie' vibe that just felt right.* \n\n**Hustle** - 7/10 - *A movie with this many non-actors will usually get distracting, but this pulled it off. A really solid sports-drama-comedy.* \n\n**The Woman King** - 7/10 \n\n**Parallel Mothers** - 7/10 - *Well-built and well-acted like every Almodovar movie, but like All About My Mother and a few others, the melodrama chokes out the story and doesn't leave much room for any growth to the story. Penelope Cruz killed it as usual. Dollar Store Javier Bardem was pretty good too (it really did feel like Bardem wasn't available for the shoot so they got his doppelganger to replace him last-minute.)*\n\n**Dog** - 7/10\n\n**The Tender Bar** - 7/10 - *Ben Affleck just straight up stole the show. He was made for this supporting role and he'd get my vote at the Oscars. One of the sweeter (although a bit over-sentimental) movies of the year. You can just tell it was a book first. Mixed in with a great soundtrack, brought down a bit by Tye Sheridan.*\n\n**Bullet Train** - 7/10\n\n**Barbarian** - 7/10\n\n**Plaza Catedral** - 7/10\n\n**Hit the Road** - 7/10\n\n**The Forgiven** - 7/10 - *It felt like a fully-loaded play with a million interesting characters. Great dialogue.*\n\n**Thor: Love and Thunder** - 7/10\n\n**See How They Run** - 7/10 - *If the universe was fair, we'd have a 10-film series of Sam Rockwell and Saiorse Ronan solving crimes together. It takes a usual whoddunit movie, then flips it, then flips it, then flips it again.* \n\n**Pearl** - 7/10\n\n**Bones and All** - 7/10 - *I wanted to love this a lot more. Michae Stuhlbarg is wasted and I'm so tired of Mark Rylance playing the same exact character every movie. I get that he's widely-regarded as one of the greatest theater actors of his generation, but I find him very one-dimensional in film. This was a good movie, but I think it could've been a lot better.*\n\n**Hold Me Tight** - 7/10 - *An amazing performance from Vicky Krieps, but it gets a bit too jumbled/confusing for me to give it a higher score. It felt like a puzzle missing a few pieces. Maybe that's the point. I don't know. The 2 intertwining realities kind of blend it together.*\n\n**2nd Chance** - 7/10\n\n**Three Thousand Years of Longing** - 7/10 - *George Miller swings for the fences, sometimes it lands, sometimes it crashes. This lands, and then crashes.*\n\n**Coupez!** - 7/10 - *I went in thinking this was just a remake of the Japanese One Cut of the Dead, but was pleasantly surprised that it went another layer deep. If you want a horror-meta-comedy, this is it.*\n\n**God's Country** - 7/10\n\n**Maigret** - 7/10 -  *Decent, predictable, and mostly-forgettable crime procedural set in 1950s France, but does enough to keep you interested in the murder-mystery. You can figure it out pretty early on though.*\n\n**Wild Men** - 7/10 \n\n**DC League of Superpets** - 7/10\n\n**The Box** - 7/10\n\n**Compartment Number 6** - 7/10\n\n**Ambulance** - 7/10 - *I know I'm supposed to hate this, but I just can't. I could list a million reasons why it sucks: The constant tonal changes (from a little girl literally being impaled by a fence to a few wise-ass jokes a minute later), so much product placement I felt like I was watching the Super Bowl, the sun being blasted into my eyeballs every 5 seconds (we get it Michael Bay, the sun exists), a super-weird marriage counseling scene, the awkward camera angles, etc. All that being said, it was just a whole lot of fun.* \n\n**To Leslie** - 7/10 - *Crippling alcoholism is a common theme at the movies this year. Andrea Risenborough and Marc Maron are awesome in this, but it's mostly something you've already seen before.* \n\n**Moonage Daydream** - 7/10 - *Was worth watching in IMAX (not often this can be said for a doc), but not my favorite documentary of the year. Memory of a Free Festival has been stuck on my playlist since watching this movie.*\n\n**A Love Song** - 7/10\n\n**Confess, Fletch** - 7/10\t- *Jon Hamm awkwardly and confidently finds himself in the middle of an intercontinental murder-mystery. It's as fun as it sounds. Watch it.*\n\n**Vengeance** - 7/10\n\n**Nostalgia** - 7/10\n\n**Amalgama** - 7/10\n\n**Wet Sand** - 7/10\n\n**Argentina, 1985** - 6/10 - *The tone was kind of weird, I went in expecting a fully-serious trial-drama (about post-dictatorship Argentina and the trial of the military leaders that ordered thousands of murders), but it ended up being played for a lot of laughs. Still a pretty good legal-drama though.*\n\n**Clerks III** - 7/10\n\n**Navalny** - 7/10\n\n**Sundown** - 7/10 - *Lowkey, vague, slow, sun-drenched chiller that sticks with you.*\n\n**Jockey** - 7/10 - \n\n**The Duke** - 7/10\n\n**That Kind of Summer** - 7/10 - *Not many movies are this honest and open about sexual experiences.*\n\n**18 1/2** - 7/10 - *Take a weird ass turn near the end but I enjoyed the bizzaro-alternate-history angle. Watergate told from a fictional personal point of view.*\n\n**Watcher** - 7/10 - *Maika Monroe in a psychological-thriller, what more needs to be said?*\n\n**Last Film Show** - 7/10\n\n**Everything Went Fine** - 7/10 \n\n**Scream** - 7/10\n\n**Cyrano** - 7/10 - *Impressive set pieces & choreography and an amazing sound track (\"Wherever I Fall\" is a song I find myself going back to a lot, same with \"Someone to Say\"), but a like most of Joe Wright's work, it ends up a bit on the wrong side of bland. The great long-shot battle scene reminded of a lot of what he did during the famous beach beach in Atonement. Bonus points for the full-on commitment from Peter Dinklage, Kelvin Harrison Jr, and Haley Bennett, you really felt it on screen. Pre-2020 I could see this movie having been a huge crowd-pleasing hit, like The Greatest Showman. Kind of a bummer it flopped so hard.*\n\n**Violent Night** - 7/10\n\n**Spoiler Alert** - 7/10\n\n**Ali & Ava** - 7/10\n\n**The Territory** - 7/10\n\n**The Lost Daughter** - 7/10 \n\n**Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom** - 7/10\n\n**The Daughter** - 7/10 \n\n**Soul of a Beast** - 7/10\n\n**Vortex** - 6/10 - *Technically impressive, and Alex Lutz had a really amazing supporting performance, but there's only so much double-perspective aimless wandering I can take, and it turns out 2 hours and 29 minutes is past my limit. Dario Argento's terrible French was really distracting too, he was really struggling to get lines out, and not in the natural way you'd expect/want. If you're in the mood to have your heart and soul crushed by the horrors of old age and the degenerative brain diseases that await many of us, I'd highly suggest *The Father* or *Amour* over this movie. Hardcore Gaspar Noe fans will like it though, he has a unique way of getting under your skin, and he definitely digs here. I liked the maze-like/claustrophobic/cramped feel of the apartment though, that really elevated the whole thing. The shower scene and the gas scene really hit, liked those a lot.* \n\n**Pinocchio** - 6/10 \n\n**Beast** - 6/10\n\n**Decision to Leave** - 6/10 - *Muddled, confusing, weird tonal changes, but it did look great. The most disappointing movie of the year for me, especially considering The Handmaiden is one of my all-time favorites. Neither a good romantic story nor a crime-drama. It's kind of just stuck in between.*\n\n**White Noise** - 6/10 - *9/10 first half, 3/10 second half. The train derailment in the movie kind of happened at the same time as the derailment of the movie itself. Neat.*\n\n**Emergency** - 6/10 \n\n**The Bob's Burgers Movie** - 6/10\n\n**Uncharted** - 6/10\n\n**The Quiet Girl** - 6/10 - *I had really high expectations for this going in. It was one of the year's biggest indie hits in the UK & Ireland and it was a festival darling all across the globe. I thought it ended up being....just fine? It's a pretty generic story, an unwanted/overlooked child gets sent away to distant relatives in the country and they bond over shared trauma/sadness. It was well-shot and well-acted, but I was mostly left disappointed.*\n\n**Saint Omer** - 6/10\n\n**Armageddon Time** - 6/10 - *Anne Hathaway and Anthony Hopkins made this worth watching. Everything else, not so much.*\n\n**The 355** - 6/10 - *An okay, generic, time-wasting action-thriller, with every plot twist you'd expect and a few good one-liners and world-travelling set-pieces (think *Triple Frontier*, or a Jason Statham/Liam Neeson vehicle with better cinematography).\n\n**Brian and Charles** - 6/10 - *An extremely British Lars and the Real Girl.*\n\n**A Taste of Hunger** - 6/10\n\n**Lightyear** - 6/10\n\n**Jackass Forever** - 6/10\n\n**Death on the Nile** - 6/10 - *The fun thing about a murder-mystery is that deaths carry a lot of weight. Killing off half of the characters really destroys that weight and removes any sort of investment I had in the movie. A fun script and good acting kept this afloat.* \n\n**Moonfall** - 6/10 - *Watching Armageddon, The Core, and The Day After Tomorrow 500x times each as a kid will always keep a soft-spot in my heart for movies like this.* \n\n**The Outfit** - 6/10\n\n**The Greatest Beer Run Ever** - 6/10\n\n**Empire of Light** - 6/10 - *It looked gorgeous and sounded amazing, but overall feels like a huge wasted opportunity. There's an amazing movie in there somewhere, as a tribute to cinema and theaters while following the cast of misfits keeping a theater alive on the south English coast, but it gets buried by a terribly-boring (and kinda creepy) main relationship, an overly-hammy performance by Olivia Colman, and way too many side-stories.* \n\n**The Drop** - 6/10 - *Painfully, absurdly, and wonderfully awkward but at the end of the day, it's a bit too stretched thin. Like an SNL sketch that goes on too long.*\n\n**Ride Above** - 6/10 - *It relies too much on being emotionally-manipulative (quadriplegic girl teams up with autistic farmhand to train horses at a failing family ranch, I mean, come on), but the racing scenes and acting keep this interesting enough.*\n\n**The Estate** - 6/10\n\n**Dual** - 6/10 - *Riley Stearns's previous movie, The Art of Self Defense, was one of my favorite dark-comedies of recent years. I liked the premise, and I liked the alcoholism parralel, but I couldn't get past the terrible casting of the two leads (Karen Gillan/Aaron Paul).*\n\n**The Bad Guys** - 6/10\n\n**Downton Abbey: A New Age** - 6/10 - *I've never seen a single episode of the show, but I've seen both movies. It didn't quite have the cozy feeling of the first one, but it was still charming and overly-extravagant enough to be enjoyable. Points lost for many clich\u00e9 plotlines.* \n\n**The Good House** - 6/10\n\n**On the Come Up** - 6/10 - *Very clunky in the middle and about 30 minutes too long, but the rap battle scenes make this a worthy watch, especially the last one.*\n\n**Eiffel** - 6/10\n\n**Confessions of a Hitman** - 6/10 - *My dream movie or television project is a big-budgeted, sprawling retelling of the Quebec Biker War, but I guess this will do for now.*\n\n**Catherine Called Birdy** - 6/10\n\n**Immersion** - 6/10\n\n**Emancipation** - 6/10 - *If it wasn't for the worst color-grading I've ever seen in a major motion picture, the worst accent work of 2022, and a ridiculous hand-to-hand alligator vs Will Smith battle, this would've been pretty good.* \n\n**Three Minutes: A Lengthening** - 6/10 - *It's an interesting choice, making a full-length documentary movie from a 3-minute clip of a pre-WW2 town, but I think it was stretched too thin.*\n\n**Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore** - 6/10\n\n**All of the Old Knives** - 6/10 - *Not great, but I liked the 'old-school-and-overcomplicated-spy-movies-they-dont-make-anymore' vibe this had going on. It really is a throwback to 1990s camp.*\n\n**My Name Is Sara** - 6/10\n\n**Master** - 6/10\n\n**Don't Worry, Darling** - 6/10\n\n**Men** - 6/10 - *I absolutely loved Ex Machina. I absolutely hated Annihilation. This is somewhere in the middle. Alex Garland has been very 'style over substance' for me in his past 2 features. Jessie Buckley was great as always though.*\n\n**Where the Crawdads Sing** - 6/10 \n\n**Till** - 6/10 - *In a vacuum, Danielle Deadwyler's courtroom scene is probably the most well-acted and captivating single moment I've seen on the big screen this year, and it deservedly should get her an Oscar nomination, but the movie as a whole wasn't as great as it should have been.*\n\n**Call Jane** - 6/10\n\n**Luck** - 6/10 \n\n**Corner Office** - 6/10 - *In some moments, it's a really funny/relatable satire of workplace dynamics and the total absurdity of office culture, but most of the time, it's just too dry and slow to work. Really close to greatness though. I do love the variety of Jon Hamm's projects recently though.* \n\n**Nocebo** - 6/10\n\n**Nanny** - 6/10 \n\n**Christmas Bloody Christmas** - 6/10 - *The first 70 minutes were good and the 2 mains had great/fun chemistry, getting drunk and discussing movies/music while people get brutally murdered around them. Then the last 15 minutes really dragged, really stretching for runtime there. Loved the physical media references throughout (Vinegar Syndrome, Severin, etc.).*\n\n**Firebird** - 6/10 \n\n**Moon Man** - 6/10 \n\n**Amsterdam** - 5/10 - *Kind of a mess, but Christian Bale makes it watchable. John David Washington on the other hand puts in one of the worst performances of the year.*\n\n**Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths** - 5/10 - *Some of the best editing and set design of the year. The rest did not work.*\n\n**Sin La Habana** - 5/10\n\n**Jurassic World Dominion** - 5/10 - *If Top Gun: Maverick is the perfect blockbuster, this is the blandest blockbuster. Too many characters you don't care about, too many stupid decisions, too many side-plots. It's passable but I'll never watch it again. Let this franchise rest for a while.*\n\n**American Dreamer** - 5/10 - *Peter Dinklage and slapstick comedy can only carry this so far.*\n\n**You Won't Be Alone** - 5/10 - *If Terrence Malick directed a folk-horror. Sounds amazing, but didn't do anything for me.*\n\n**Minions: Rise of Gru** - 5/10\n\n**Benediction** - 5/10 \n\n**Fall** - 5/10\n\n**Belle** - 5/10 \n\n**Mr Malcolm's List** - 5/10 \n\n**Spirited** - 5/10 \n\n**Passing** - 5/10 - *It was slow, but fine, until the ending blows the whole thing up. God that was bad. That should have stayed in the novel, it didn't translate to the screen at all.*\n\n**Strawberry Mansion** - 5/10 \n\n**Mrs Harris Goes to Paris** - 5/10 \n\n**Arlette** - 5/10 - *Basically a French Canadian Veep, but not nearly as biting or funny, except for a few moments. I can appreciate the fact that a movie mocking the government is partially funded by the government, especially in a movie about supporting culture and the arts, but the ending mostly deflates that goodwill.* \n\n**Memories of My Father** - 5/10 - *The most dragged-out, melodramatic death scene you've ever seen in your life.* \n\n**Plan A** - 5/10 \n\n**So Damn Easy Going** - 5/10\n\n**Ticket to Paradise** - 5/10 - *Super-safe, super-sanitized, super-predictable, but I am happy that movies like this are still getting made and are bringing people to the theaters. I also wish more movies did blooper reels during the credits like this did, that's always fun.*\n\n**The Automat** - 5/10 - *If it hadn't turned into a glorified Starbucks ad in the middle, this might've been pretty good.*\n\n**Maixabel** - 5/10 \n\n**Estacion Catorce** - 5/10\n\n**The Tale of King Crab** - 5/10\n\n**The Lost City** - 5/10 - *Tracy Buttstuff.*\n\n**Sonic 2** - 5/10\n\n**The Contractor** - 5/10 - *15 years ago, this would have been a huge, $150M-budgeted, franchise-starting, summer blockbuster starring Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. Now, it's a lifeless and confusing action movie pretending to have political intrigue. I'm surprised it didn't also co-star John Travolta.*\n\n**Mothering Sunday** - 5/10 - *If you like naked people walking around aimlessly, this is the movie for you.*\n\n**Bros** - 5/10\n\n**The Cow Who Sang A Song Into the Future** - 5/10 - *It bites off more than it can chew. It tries to tackle so many issues at once but can't* \n\n**Apples** - 5/10\n\n**Breaking** - 5/10 - *John Boyega doing his best 'Denzel Washington in John Q' impression. Some scenes are so over-acted (especially with the bank manager), that they become accidentally-funny.*\n\n**Les Tricheurs** - 5/10\n\n**Black Adam** - 5/10\n\n**Loving Highsmith** - 5/10\n\n**Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile** - 5/10 - *If only this could have lived up to the wonderful & lively opening dance/singing sequence between Javier Bardem and Lyle. It all goes downhill from there. Honestly, take out the stupid family (terrible casting all-around there, especially the kid) and clich\u00e9 bad-neighbor, and increase the Bardem/Lyle scenes by 300%, and you've got something great.* \n\n**Utama** - 5/10 - *I get it. A family's way of life is dying and a stubborn, aging patriarch is bringing dragging them down with it. It's got great, sprawling landscape shots and feels very grounded, but I was just so bored.*\n\n**Father Stu** - 5/10\n\n**Strange World** - 5/10 \n\n**Ahed's Knee** - 5/10 - *I feel like I don't know enough about middle-eastern geopolitical issues for this to work for me, much like the director's previous movie (Synonyms).*\n\n**Memory** - 5/10 - *As far as \"im too old for this shit' Liam Neeson action movies this year go, this is miles ahead of Blacklight (see: bottom of this), but that's not a high bar.*\n\n**Unidentified Objects** - 5/10\n\n**The Good Nurse** - 4/10 - *Drab, generic crime story that lacks any tension or suspense. Chastain was good, Redmayne was terrible.* \n\n**The Eternal Daughter** - 4/10 - *Watching a Joanna Hogg movie is like accidentally and awkwardly walking into someone else's therapy session, or it's like the feeling of waking up and instantly forgetting an insanely-vivid dream. It's uncomfortable.*\n\n**Frank and Penelope** - 4/10 - *Could be good if you're in the mood for a pulpy, cheap, late-night, Tarantino-ripoff crime movie, but it wasn't for me.*\n\n**Flee** - 4/10\n\n**A Journal for Jordan** - 4/10\n\n**You Resemble Me** - 4/10 - *Watch November instead.* \n\n**American Underdog** - 4/10 - *Could've been alright with more football and less sentimental-cheesy romance/religious stuff.*\n\n**Infinite Storm** - 4/10 - *I'm really burnt-out on survival-dramas. I had trouble staying awake during this one.*\n\n**Morbius** - 4/10\n\n**Attachment** - 4/10\n\n**Salvatore: The Shoemaker of Dreams** - 4/10 - *Once in a while, really talented people get together for a bunch of fast money and make an extended commercial that's not worthy of their talent.*\n\n**The Silent Twins** - 4/10\n\n**Summering** - 4/10\n\n**Jane** - 4/10\n\n**My Donkey, My Lover, and I** - 4/10 - *Totally corny and painfully unfunny. Watch Wild instead, if you're in the mood for a 'middle aged woman goes hiking to discover herself' movie. Cool donkey though, points for that. Wine moms probably love this movie.*\n\n**Aline** - 4/10 \n\n**Wildhood** - 4/10 - *There is not a single original bone in this body. The acting was atrocious.*\n\n**Waiting for Bojangles** - 4/10\n\n**Paws of Fury** - 4/10 - *The story behind the production of this movie is far more interesting than anything the movie itself offers.*\n\n**Delia's Gone** - 4/10 - *I thought Diane Keaton in Mack & Rita would run away with the honor, but Marissa Tomei in this movie easily puts in one of the worst performances I've ever seen on the big screen. It was like a bad parody of Matthew McConaughey in True Detective. Stephan James is picking really bad projects post-*Beale Street*.*\n\n**Jane by Charlotte** - 4/10 - *If a lame Mother's Day card was made into a movie. The anti-Ghost of Richard Harris. Awkward and clunky.*\n\n**Studio 666** - 4/10\n\n**I Am Here** - 4/10\n\n**Detectives vs Sleuths** - 4/10 - *One of the most convoluted, nonsensical crime movies I've ever seen (I've seen The Snowman and nothing is ever topping that). A total mess from start to finish. Could not keep track of any character or motivation or \"case number\".*\n\n**The Invitation** - 3/10 - *I remember watching this in 2019 when it was named Ready or Not and didn't suck. I've never seen a vampire movie so afraid of an R rating. Laugh-out-loud stupid ending that should have been cut.*\n\n**My Policeman** - 3/10 - *Boring. Really came close to falling asleep a few times. Extremely sedated romantic-drama. I'd rather there was no \"future\" version of the characters, just the originals. Maybe that would've made it better.*\n\n**Leonor Will Never Die** - 3/10 - *Too meta. Too quirky. I felt like I was on the outside of an inside joke the whole time.*\n\n**Last Flight Home** - 3/10 - *There's something overly-sanitized, overly-edited, fake, control-heavy, and gross about this documentary. Just didn't feel right. At its core, its the story of a dysfunctional family milking their father's assisted suicide for their own needs. A sad, lonely man watching politics on TV in his final days, reminiscing about the good old days and reaching for death, while his family films it.*\n\n**Rifkin's Festival** - 3/10 - *Wallace Shawn was so awful in this. Woody Allen has some classics, but this is rock-bottom.*\n\n**Marry Me** - 3/10\n\n**The King's Daughter** - 3/10 - *I don't think anybody else saw this in theaters. I remember Pierce Brosnan's hair, that's it.*\n\n**Both Sides of the Blade** - 3/10 - *I'm a huge fan of Claire Denis, but some of her more recent movies have left me more irritated than anything else. If you want to watch 2 hours of an annoying couple just bicker at each other for no reason, I guess you might enjoy this. I hated all 3 main characters. I didn't care about what happened at all. Worst love triangle ever.*\n\n**The Rose Maker** - 3/10\n\n**Mack & Rita** - 3/10 - *\"She's so old every second counts\" was the only redeeming line or memorable moment. It felt like a movie that was supposed to come out 20 years ago. Freaky Friday, but creepy.*\n\n**Firestarter** - 3/10\n\n**Easter Sunday** - 3/10 - *Awkward, unfunny, cheap-looking.* \n\n**Medieval** - 2/10 - *Some of the all-time funniest/awful line-dubbing by Michael Caine in this. Maybe the worst-edited movie I've ever seen. The story is impossible to follow.*\n\n**Hatching** - 2/10\n\n**Three Headed Beast** - 2/10 - *What should have been an experimental 10-minute short is stretched out to an extremely thin and taxing 85 minutes. A boring relationship-drama about extremely unlikeable and annoying characters.*\n\n**Matrix Resurrections** - 2/10\n\n**The Railway Children Return** - 2/10 - *From the poster you'd think this was just a cheesy, bland, forgettable British period drama. It turns out you'd be right.*\n\n**Enys Men** - 2/10 - *Every folk horror clich\u00e9 messily jumbled together into a bundle of total nonsense along with purposefully out of synch audio and bad visuals. 90 minutes of pure cinematic torture.*\n\n**Please Baby Please** - 2/10 - *I wonder how they got Demi Moore to be in this. I feel like that's an interesting story.*\n\n**Simple Passion** - 2/10 - *The \"French people having lots of sex\" genre hits rock bottom here. It's like if a Lifetime movie accidentally got approved for an NC-17 rating.*\n\n**Like Me** - 1/10 - *A boring & annoying & explicit soap opera masquerading as a full-length feature film.*\n\n**Blacklight** - 1/10 - Possibly the worst \"action\" film I've ever watched. This was \"post-2000 Steven Seagal Action Movie\" bad.

        "Body/Content": "##1. Introduction\n\nYou open your favourite social media site. You see the same discussions come up again.\n\nPower creep. Player rewards. The monthly gacha revenue PvP leaderboards.\n\nBut it feels like something is missing. These issues all feel related. But how? And why can two games made by the same developer still feel so different despite having so many similarities?\n\nThat\u2019s what I want to talk about today:\n\n* How do gacha companies think about revenue?\n* Why does your core game design matter for monetization?\n* How does your game vision / content design / value delivery change based on your monetization goals?\n\nI will use Genshin and HSR for my examples, but the lessons and concepts are applicable to lots of other live services and gacha games more broadly as well.\n\nYou may find this easier to read on [my companion blog](https://moonbearmusings.com/lets-talk-about-how-mihoyos-monetization-works/) due to Reddit post limits and restrictions (such as the inability to post cute art in-line with text!).\n\n##2. How does revenue even work for gacha companies?\n\nAt its core, gacha companies make money by making you roll the gacha. Their revenue can therefore be modelled as:\n\n> **Revenue** = **Player Desire to Consume** (e.g. gacha / Resin refresh / BP / etc.) - **Free Income**\n\nSo there\u2019s only two ways for gacha companies to make more money from its players. Either:\n\n1. Make you want to consume more; or\n2. Limit your free income\n\nIt also happens that both of these levers are fully in control of the game studio. Therefore, all players exist in a fully planned and controlled economy the game studio owns.\n\n###2a. \u201cGenerosity\u201d is calibrated to drive a specific baseline revenue\n\nAll free income effectively subsidises the spending of your players. So how do you determine what the optimal subsidisation level is?\n\n* When you have a large enough player base, you can divide up your players into specific groups and study their spending behaviour.\n  * Modelling the player base at an aggregate level works because even though individual players make very personal decisions for their spending (e.g. meta value / character personality / character \u201cpersonality\u201d / etc.), in large enough groups the behaviour is predictable and normalised.\n* Because free income directly offsets player spend, free income should not scale linearly with purchasable content. Instead, you should measure the [elasticity of demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_\\(economics\\)) for your key player demographics\n  * *i.e. the change in purchasing behaviour to changes in factors such as price or income*\n  * The more inelastic your player behaviour, the less free income should scale with purchasable content\n* You can then scenario model different levels of free income subsidisation and determine the revenue maximising level of subsidy\n\nFor a basic demonstration of subsidisation effects, let\u2019s compare how Mihoyo monetizes Genshin vs HSR. We can create several simple personas to represent different demographics of players:\n\n* **Super-Whale Seto:** Screw the rules, Seto has money. They instantly C6 every character on release.\n* **Meta Morgan:** Morgan is a Tactician and their parent Robin taught them to have lots of tactical options. As a dolphin they pull for half of the Limited characters that release every region and get C2 / E2 on all of them.\n* **F2P Florian:** Florian spends all their money buying Vitamins, Mints, and Stellar Terra Shards. So they don\u2019t have any money left to spend on gacha games.\n\nSo what do we find if we do the maths?\n\n**Super-Whale Seto** | **Genshin** | **HSR**\n---|---|---\n*Average Spend Per Patch (USD)* | 1,350 | 2,500\n*Average Chars Pulled Per Patch* | 7.6 | 14.0\n*% Char Ownership* | 100% | 100%\n\n**Meta Morgan** | **Genshin** | **HSR**\n---|---|---\n*Average Spend Per Patch (USD)* | 160 | 350\n*Average Chars Pulled Per Patch* | 1.6 | 3.0\n*% Char Ownership* | 50% | 50%\n\n**F2P Florian** | **Genshin** | **HSR**\n---|---|---\n*Average Spend Per Patch (USD)* | 0 | 0\n*Average Chars Pulled Per Patch* | 0.8 | 1.1\n*% Char Ownership* | 71% | 57%\n\nSo what conclusions can we draw from this analysis?\n\n* Mihoyo isn\u2019t stupid. The extra free rolls in HSR are **undermined by the faster character release schedule**;\n* The free income barely subsidises the faster character release schedule. This implies that Mihoyo has determined that **most dolphin / whale players have highly inelastic spending behaviour**;\n* F2P players in HSR **get to pull for more characters overall** which can be more satisfying;\n* BUT if an F2P player likes more than 60% of the characters Mihoyo makes, then Genshin lets them **own a greater proportion of the total character pool**;\n* So in the end ~~it doesn't even matter~~ the **F2P generosity in HSR pulls is funded by squeezing the dolphins and whales harder** by making them spend approx 2x or more what they spend in Genshin\n\n\u201cGenerosity\u201d therefore is a meaningless word. When a gacha game developer gives you free income, the most important question is: \u201cWhat is their plan to make back their money?\u201d\n\n###2b. Why don\u2019t all games just squeeze their whales by releasing more characters?\n\nRemember, there are two ways for gacha companies to make more money from its players:\n\n1. Make you want to consume more; or\n2. Limit your free income\n\nSo how do gacha companies make you want to consume more?\n\nGames are a series of interconnected systems. You cannot just make changes to one system without cascading effects to every other system in your game. For example, your character release pace has significant implications for:\n\n* Game combat and combat mechanics design;\n* The speed of power creep and the impact of power creep;\n* Player account development and farming mechanics;\n* etc.\n\nSo\u2026 let\u2019s talk about all of this then. How does a gacha game\u2019s core game design need to be built around its income structure?\n\n##3. Game Design meets Monetization\n\nThere is always tension between design and monetization. However, a cohesive game should ideally have its game design and monetization features work together as much as possible. If the two aspects fight with each other too much, then it ruins the player experience.\n\nAn example of the [homo-economicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus) brain thinking too hard about price sensitivity and not enough about how games actually work is John Riccitiello, former CEO of Electronic Arts and Unity:\n\n> *[When you are six hours into playing Battlefield and you run out of ammo in your clip, and we ask you for a dollar to reload, you're really not very price sensitive at that point in time.](https://old.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/7cpdrn/ea_ceo_john_riccitiellos_thoughts_on/)*\n\nJohn Riccitiello is an example of someone who doesn\u2019t actually understand how game design works. His career started in Consumer Packaged Good (CPG) such as Chlorox, Pepsi, and H\u00e4agen-Dazs.\n\nThis is the consequence of not understanding game design and how it must support your monetization goals: A nightmare of a game that fundamentally does not respect its players. And in turn, you create bad games that flop.\n\n###3a. Let\u2019s talk about how design works in RPG games then\n\nDesign is a massive open topic and varies massively depending on what you\u2019re talking about. For the sake of brevity, I\u2019m just going to focus on role-playing games (both action RPG such as Genshin or turn-based RPG such as HSR).\n\nA large focus in role-playing games is combat. Satisfying combat is about the balance between the combat encounters versus the player and the \u201cpower\u201d the player has.\n\nVery broadly speaking, in most games the \u201cpower\u201d a player has is determined by what their account owns. This is a combination of:\n\n> **Power** = **Player Skill** (e.g. game knowledge, reflexes, etc.) + **Characters** (e.g. base numbers, element / path, etc.) + **Gear** (e.g. Artifacts / Relics, weapons, etc.)\n\nOther games in these genres will follow similar structure although the exact terminology and systems may vary (e.g. Craft Essences such as Kaleidoscope in FGO are an example of Gear, MMORPGs such as FFXIV have Classes instead of Characters, etc.)\n\nMonetization will directly influence how the 3 components of player skill, character kit, and gear are designed and balanced.\n\nThe key goal in monetization is for your game\u2019s systems to create continuous and regular impulses to spend.\n\nA healthy long-term monetization system should therefore have repeatable design levers that can be used to reliably generate demand without compromising the core gameplay experience.\n\n###3b. How does power work for Genshin vs HSR?\n\nLet\u2019s consider the difference between Genshin and HSR and what this means for the power equation.\n\n**Factor** | **Genshin** | **HSR**\n---|---|----\n*Player Skill: Game balance* | Even the most whale player still needs to learn how to actually press buttons, play a rotation, etc. Skilled players can also take advantage of mechanics such as i-frames. | You can just turn on auto-battle if you\u2019re strong enough. Zero thinking or player skill required. This means a player can literally have zero skill and Mihoyo can still design content for them.\n*Player Skill vs Char Kit* | Players can use skill to overcome character kit limitations *(e.g. manually grouping enemies to AoE them down)* | No amount of player skill can make a single target attack do AoE damage\n*Characters: Ease of building* | Talent Books can only be farmed with Resin or bought with Genesis Crystals | Trace materials can be bought with non-paid currency\n*Characters: Ease of building* | 46 Boss Materials for full uncap with 2.55 average drops per run and 40 Resin per run requires 720 Resin on average or 96 hours of Resin. | 65 Boss Materials for full uncap with 5 drops per run and 30 Trailblaze Power (TP) per Run requires 390 TP or 39 hours of TP.\n*Characters: Power Creep* | Slow level of power creep. Many 4-Star chars are meta-defining and have been for years. | Faster power creep. No reason to use a 4-Star if a 5-Star char equivalent exists.\n*Gear: Artifacts / Relics Set Bonuses* | Very powerful with clear BIS choices and Resin efficient Domains to farm (e.g. Momiji for EOSF / Shim, Denouement for MH / GT) | Many 4pc set bonuses are bad and 2pc / 2pc or Rainbow is very viable. There is no clear Momiji level of Resin efficient Domain\n*Gear: Artifacts / Relics* | Difficult to min / max | The increased number of things your substats can roll into makes it harder to obtain min / max pieces\n\nI can go on and on (e.g. Strongbox vs Synthesizing). But hopefully you can already start to see the pattern and main conclusion:\n\n**HSR has a stronger emphasis on the balance of power for Characters. Devaluing everything else in the power equation means forcing you to roll for more characters to reliably access power.**\n\nThis makes perfect sense. We saw that HSR has a much stronger focus on squeezing its players through faster character release schedules as part of its core monetisation focus.\n\nTo make this monetization approach work, the game design of HSR itself must be skewed around characters as well. Players need to be pressured to pull for characters frequently enough, and the game needs to make it as easy to \u201conboard\u201d characters onto an account:\n\n* A game that **wants you to constantly pull new characters** has to be a game that **makes levelling and building characters easy**;\n* The game has to **make it more difficult for you to brute force content by having good gear** (that you didn\u2019t gacha for at least) compared to an equivalent game;\n* The game has to **design content that requires owning a wider variety of characters**\n\nSo we understand that game developers can tweak the balance of power to influence spending. But players (mostly) don\u2019t accumulate power for the sake of power. Players need content that\u2019s worth accumulating power for.\n\nSo we need to look at the other flip side of design in RPGs: Encounters and combat.\n\n###3c. The live services content pipeline must follow your monetization approach\n\nTraditional RPGs and live services gacha RPGs have a significant difference that fundamentally alters how content can be designed.\n\nIn traditional RPGs, the variation in power between players will be very narrow because developers have full control of a player\u2019s power. This means that enemy encounter design and difficulty can be highly customised and fine tuned based on the tools the developer knows the player has.\n\nFor example, in Fire Emblem the developer can choose when players get access to higher tier weapons or class promotion items. If the developer knows what the maximum damage a player can do, then they know how to balance fight difficulty.\n\nHowever, this is not possible in gacha games because at any moment, the player can just pull out a credit card. The wide spread in power between players means that traditional encounter design techniques do not work.\n\nInstead, combat design needs to use design approaches that:\n\n1. Rely on restricting / punishing players; and\n2. Lean into the variance and encourage spending to brute force content\n3. Create methods that are repeatable and reusable.\n\nSo how is the approach different for Genshin vs HSR?\n\n####3ci. HSR focuses on restrictive gameplay by dividing characters by kit features\n\nHSR is a game that emphasises characters within the power equation. So combat design likewise creates a reward / punish approach to matching the right character for the right job.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with HSR, all characters are classified by their \u2018Path\u2019. Very loosely speaking, you can think of them as RPG classes. For example:\n\n**Path** | **Feature**\n---|---\n*Nihility* | Debuffers including DoT-based characters\n*Preservation* | Defensive characters / \u201cTanks\u201d and Shields\n*Hunt* | Single-target DPS characters\n*Erudition* | AoE-focused DPS characters\n\nHSR further subdivides this by also having multiple ways to structure and classify attacks such as Follow-Up Attacks (FUA), damage scaling with shields, etc. The turn-based combat system also allows for other mechanics around manipulating the turn order.\n\nThis means that HSR is built from the ground up to have a massive number of levers that Mihoyo can manipulate to design combat encounters. This structure lets Mihoyo create puzzle-style gameplay that uses combat as the vehicle for delivering the puzzle.\n\nThe characters you own and the tools available in their kits form the solutions to the \u201ccombat puzzles\u201d. As a result, HSR combat can be structured to punish or reward players based on the characters they own and can use.\n \n#####3ci-1. Simulated Universe\n\nA great example is the Simulated Universe (SU) game mode. SU is a rogue-like game mode based around Path themes. For example, playing the Elation path in SU buffs your FUAs.\n\nThis means the game mode is explicitly restrictive. Afterall, if you don\u2019t own a character that can create shields, then what is the point of playing the Preservation Path SU mode which completely revolves around shields?\n\nThe new Divergent Universe mode is also noteworthy:\n\n* The Destruction Path has been heavily modified to promote gameplay around the Break mechanic rather than raw damage, which earlier iterations of SU focused on;\n* Break related Blessings and Equations have also been pushed very heavily and are so overtuned that Break is one of the best strategies in this game mode; and\n* At higher difficulty levels (Protocol 6), enemies have a damage reduction modifier when not in the Break / weakened state.\n\nHSR also released the character Firefly (a highly anticipated Break-specific Destruction character) in the same patch Divergent Universe was released. What a coincidence!\n\n#####3ci-2. Events\n\nThe stages within combat events are often focused explicitly on specific features of combat to create the puzzle structure that explicitly encourages or discourages certain playstyles.\n\nThe logical extension of this is [The Legend of Galactic Baseballer](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/The_Legend_of_Galactic_Baseballer) event. This is a fun rogue-like game mode event that is explicitly built around constructing scenarios that use character kit tools as problem solving answers.\n\nThe Galactic Baseballer event then rewards you for using the right character kit tools with massive numbers, game breaking effects such as turn manipulation, and the accompanying  big number dopamine hits.\n\n#####3ci-3. Pure Fiction / Memory of Chaos / Apocalyptic Shadow\n\nThese game modes are \u201cend game\u201d modes similar to the Spiral Abyss in Genshin.\n\nThe Pure Fiction game mode is explicitly an AoE-focused wave-based game mode. Because grouping does not exist, then players either own characters who have AoE damage or they don\u2019t own characters with AoE.\n\nBefore Pure Fiction, the main end-game mode was Memory of Chaos (MoC). What happened to MOC design before and after Pure Fiction\u2019s release in Patch 1.6?\n\n**Patch** | **Total # Enemies** | **% Elite or Boss**\n---|---|---\n*1.0* | 38 | 32%\n*1.1* | 38 | 32%\n*1.2* | 36 | 33%\n*1.3* | 20 | 60%\n*1.4* | 18 | 67%\n*1.5-1* | 21 | 57%\n*1.5-2* | 20 | 60%\n*1.6-1* | ***14*** | ***86%***\n*1.6-2* | 15 | 100%\n*2.0-1* | 17 | 82%\n*2.0-2* | 17 | 88%\n*2.1* | 15 | 100%\n*2.2* | 18 | 83%\n\nAs soon as the AoE game mode launched, Mihoyo got rid of most of the trash mobs in the hardest MoC floors. Instead, they dramatically raised the difficulty with harder enemies and a greater focus on single target damage.\n\nAfterall, players shouldn\u2019t be rewarded twice for owning AoE characters\u2026 right?\n\nLikewise, Pure Fiction has also been a game mode that has rotated between a fixed set of 3 buffs rewarding\n\n* Ultimates (Patches 1.6 and 2.1);\n* DoT damage (Patches 1.6 and 2.2);\n* and FUA damage (Patches 2.0, 2.1, and 2.3).\n\nIt is very clear at this point that Mihoyo explicitly expects players to build teams around these themes and pull for the required supporting characters in the gacha.\n\n####3cii. Genshin has fewer levers for restrictive gameplay so its design looks different\n\nHSR was built from the ground up to have multiple combat systems that could explicitly reward or punish players. Genshin was not.\n\nGeshin also has a larger focus on other components in the power equation which contributes to variance between players (e.g. player skill, Artifact quality). This in turn lets players brute force content.\n\nFor example, do you know someone who basically plays the exact same teams every single Abyss (and completely ignores the Spiral Abyss blessing)?\n\nSince Genshin cannot rely on the same explicit levers as HSR, it requires a different approach to game design to pressure spending.\n\n#####3cii-1. Combat: Shield Breaking\n\nThis is one of the classic approaches to Abyss combat design. Elemental shields (generally) cannot be brute forced. This means that players must make sacrifices in team building to handle them.\n\nA classic example is the 3.7 Spiral Abyss which had a combination of Hydro and Cryo Heralds. This is an encounter design that is explicitly hostile to Hydro characters and more specifically Nilou Bloom (which was a very strong and popular team).\n\nAs I wrote in my [3.7 Spiral Abyss Guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/13yv88n/lets_talk_about_learning_to_get_good_at_abyss/), Elemental Shield challenges such as these are designed as a \u201csink\u201d for key characters. In this case, the 3.7 Spiral Abyss Left Half was designed as a Bennett and (to a lesser extent) Nahida \u201csink\u201d.\n\n**Structuring Abyss layouts to create team building challenges therefore punishes players who lack a deep enough character roster.**\n\n#####3cii-2. Combat: Enemy wave structures\n\nTeams in Genshin have specific rotation structures and damage profiles. Encounters can be designed to punish or reward these team structures.\n\nFor example, Ayaka Freeze is a team which has:\n\n* Initial set-up period to cast buffs and pile them onto Ayaka;\n* Frontloaded spike in damage concentrated in her Burst; and\n* Period of downtime before the second rotation can begin.\n\nThis team therefore is good at greeting a pile of AoE mobs and then asking the question: [\u201cWill it Blend?\u201d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_It_Blend%3F)\n\nBut it can also be easily punished. During Patch 3.x, Mihoyo wanted to promote its latest new teams and that meant punishing older popular teams from the 2.x era.\n\nTake [Patch 3.4 Abyss Floor](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Spiral_Abyss/Floors/2023-02-01) Floor 1-1 has 4 for example:\n\n* If all 4 Ruin Machines spawned at the same time, it'd be a pretty easy clear for Ayaya Freeze;\n* But when they spawn separately, the threshold to brute force this is so much higher.\n* As a front loaded Burst team, if you overkill the first wave then your CDs are down for the next Wave forcing you to run down the clock.\n\nYou can see similar patterns in other Abyss encounter designs:\n\n* Most enemies are no longer Venti-able precisely so you cannot solve all your problems with one character;\n* The Wenut is a boss that has explicit on / off dps phases and extremely predictable attacks to punish setup based teams and reward teams with flexible rotation structures\n  * *e.g. [C0 Ganyu can solo the Wenut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMAfw9PWZy0) because a constant stream of CAs line up very well against a boss that has low HP and is extremely predictable*\n\n**Adjusting combat encounter design is another method similar to shield breaking that can indirectly pressure player rosters.**\n\n#####3cii-3. Combat: Imaginarium Theater\n\nGenshin has also evolved to the point where the variance in even accounts without vertical investment is huge due to factors such as Artifact quality, player skill and game knowledge (do you know how to use i-frames?), etc.\n\nGenshin also can\u2019t create highly restrictive rules such as \u201cthe AoE mode\u201d and \u201cthe non-AoE mode\u201d in a game where players can just group enemies or manipulate the AI.\n\n**Genshin also has a problem where eventually it just cannot convince players to roll for characters with overlapping roles.**\n\nFor example, HSR can convince you Black Swan vs Blade are Wind DPS characters that are both worth owning because they have different Paths and uses (Nihility DoT vs Destruction Crit Scaling).\n\nBut why should someone in Genshin own Hutao vs Yoimiya vs Arlecchino vs Lyney when their team structures are so similar? Do you really need a 4th Pyro on-field DPS character when you can\u2019t own more than one Kazuha / Chevreuse / etc.?\n\nAt this point, there are only heavy handed options available to create restrictive gameplay. And so we arrive at the magic world of the Imaginarium Theater, which:\n\n* Forcibly locks accounts to specific elements; and\n* Restricting the number of times a character can be used per run\n\nThis form of ham-fisted restrictions is the natural conclusion if you create a game where:\n\n* The game systems were not built from the ground up to allow for multiple ways to differentiate between characters that perform the same role;\n* The power equation is sufficiently skewed to the point where players can brute force combat with highly invested characters; and\n* The game developers do not want to aggressively power creep characters and instead want characters to retain value over time.\n\nIt is telling that one of the few things Wuthering Waves did not copy 1-for-1 from Genshin was the Spiral Abyss. Instead, their Tower of Adversity game mode has the same Vigor system that Imaginarium Theater and [Triumphant Frenzy Event](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Triumphant_Frenzy) use.\n\n#####3cii-4. Character Kits: The \u201cBait Constellations\u201d\n\nMihoyo needs to create additional avenues of impulse spending to drain free income from players and encourage impulse spending.\n\nThis is especially true for long-term highly invested players who have developed accounts and large character rosters.\n\n* These players don\u2019t experience the same pressures to pull for new characters that a new player with an underdeveloped account does, so may pull on the gacha less; and\n* These players can stockpile their free income. So when they do finally pull, they can fully subsidize their gacha with free income only.\n\nThe approach Genshin has taken with modern character design is to push for early \u201cbait Constellations\u201d. For developed accounts looking for a taste of vertical investment, bait Constellations helps drain savings and trigger impulse spending.\n\nHow successful has this been?\n\nConsider Neuvillette. His C1 Constellation is generally highly regarded within the community. So how did the community respond?\n\n* Neuvillette overall ownership rate: 65.5%\n* Neuvillette C1 rate: 43.3%\n* Neuvillette overall C1 ownership: 28.4%\n\nSo about 1 in every 3.5 players in the entire game owns C1 Neuvillette specifically. This ignores all the players who own C2 and up.\n\nTo put this into context, there are 8 characters in the game who have an overall ownership rate less than this. There are 36 Limited characters in the game as of Patch 4.6. So, in a way, **Neuvillette\u2019s C1 Constellation by itself is more popular than 22% of the entire Genshin character roster**.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of money at stake here. So it\u2019s not surprising that Mihoyo has applied these lessons to HSR and aggressively adopted bait E1 / E2 Constellations designs.\n\n###3d. Horniness is also a form of monetization\n\nThe exception is if the motivating factor for pulling characters is horniness. Horniness is evergreen.\n\nIf the motivation for spending isn\u2019t gameplay but horniness, then you can get away with a lot. (e.g. NIKKE, Azur Lane, etc.) However, this also requires you to have a clear design vision about building a game focused on eroticism.\n\nAs such, this can only be adopted by game studios whose vision is to build a niche game and not a mass-market mainstream game.\n\n####3di. But what if I do want to make a mainstream game? What can I do?\n\nThe idea behind horniness as a driver for spending is that it is ultimately about appealing to niche individual tastes. So we can apply the same ideas here for Genshin.\n\nOne of the problems Mihoyo needs to solve is that it is running a portfolio business now. Its products Genshin, HSR, and ZZZ are all competing with each other and your monthly entertainment budget.\n\nThis means Mihoyo needs to deconflict the marquee character releases across its games.\n\n* For example, you know that Acheron is releasing in March 2024 and will be your blockbuster release that absorbs all the marketing hype;\n* You need Genshin to not detract from HSR\u2019s success and overshadow Acheron\u2019s release;\n* But you also don\u2019t want to sacrifice Genshin\u2019s revenue for free.\n\nYour goal here is to try and segment your customers as much as possible:\n\n* Allow your blockbuster release in one game to capture the majority of spending from the broad audience;\n* Extract marginal revenue with niche designs in your second game that won\u2019t compete for broad attention but drive impulse spending;\n\nWhat does this look like in practice? Well, consider Chiori. Chiori released in the same month as Acheron, a highly anticipated HSR character.\n\n**Character** | **Player Ownership Rate** | **% Owners with C6** | **% Players owning C6**\n---|---|----|----\n**Top 10 C6\u2019ed Chars** |  |   |  \n**Yelan** | 81.3%  | 12.1%  | 9.8%\n**Furina** | 83.7%  | 10.9%  | 9.2%\n**Chiori** | 18.4%  | 9.7%  | 1.8%\n**Neuvillette** | 65.5%  | 8.5%  | 5.6%\n**Wanderer** | 43.9%  | 8.4%  | 3.7%\n**Arlecchino** | 50.4%  | 7.9%  | 4.0%\n**Yae Miko** | 55.5%  | 7.9%  | 4.4%\n**Ayaka** | 69.4%  | 7.3%  | 5.1%\n**Eula** | 34%  | 7.2%  | 2.5%\n**Itto** | 21.9%  | 6.9%  | 1.5%\n**Other chars (for reference)** |  |   |  \n**Navia** | 36.5%  | 4.2%  | 1.5%\n**Ayato** | 32.4%  | 4.7%  | 1.5%\n**Alhaitham** | 32.2%  | 3.0%  | 1.0%\n\n* Chiori is a character that is in the bottom 5 for overall ownership. However, Chiori\u2019s fanbase is incredibly intense and is top 3 for C6 Rate and 2x the median C6 Rate for 5-Star characters;\n* Chiori has a comparable number of people who went all-out to C6 her compared to other generically popular character such as Navia, Ayato, and Alhaitham.\n\nExpect this trend to continue with future character releases and designs as Mihoyo experiments with ways to deconflict its character release schedules across multiple games (e.g. the split player reactions with Emilie).\n\n##4. Enshittification: When monetization goes wrong\n\nEnshittification may be a new word for you. So let\u2019s first define what it is. Because I am lazy, I am going to ~~steal~~ borrow the [Wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification):\n\n> Enshittification is the pattern of decreasing quality observed in online services and products such as Amazon, Facebook, Google Search, Twitter, Bandcamp, Reddit, Uber, and Unity.\n\nHow does this occur? The creator of the word enshittification, Cory Doctorow, [offered an explanation](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys):\n\n> Here is how platforms die: first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.\n\n> I call this enshittification, and it is a seemingly inevitable consequence arising from the combination of the ease of changing how a platform allocates value, combined with the nature of a \"two sided market\", where a platform sits between buyers and sellers, hold each hostage to the other, taking off an ever-larger share of the value that passes between them.\n\nThis is a pretty good observation by a non-business person about how basic Marketing 101 principles work.\n\nTo explain how enshittification (decreasing quality) affects live service games, I think it is helpful to:\n\n* First cover the formal Marketing theory about how enshittification occurs;\n* Secondly, I will propose an alternative reason about why products and services get worse over time;\n* Then I will explain how Mihoyo avoids enshittification; and\n* Why enshittification can help explain why Mihoyo seems so resistant to releasing skins in Genshin and HSR\n\nDue to Reddit post limits, Sections 4a and 4b have been removed and can be read on [my blog](https://moonbearmusings.com/lets-talk-about-how-mihoyos-monetization-works/).\n\n###4c. How does Mihoyo avoid enshittification?\n\nAvoiding enshittification requires having a very clear design vision and strong company leadership that lets you say \u201cNo\u201d to things.\n\nBecause commonly used metrics cannot properly measure and monitor consumer surplus, you need to:\n\n* Create principles about what your product will and will not do;\n* And then avoid temptation to deviate from those principles;\n* Even if they would make you lots of money or some customers say they want it.\n\nYou can see this reflected in Mihoyo\u2019s behaviour as a company. For example:\n\n* They are cautious to adopt radical changes to the product just because their customers ask for it and say No to a lot of things;\n* They try to minimize potential for player regret when making system-level changes;\n* They adamantly refuse to add complexity to the transaction and monetization systems within the game;\n* They try to understand whether players are satisfied by just directly asking the players through frequent in-game surveys rather than trying to guess based on wishy-washy alternative metrics.\n\n###4d. What does this have to do with skins?\n\nMihoyo seems incredibly resistant to using skins as a source of monetization in their most recent games Genshin and HSR. What might drive this?\n\nUntil they release an official statement, we can at least think about the design factors that would influence this decision.\n\n**Design Factor** | **Impact**\n---|---\n*Consumer spending behaviours* | Does player spending on skins **actually result in net new revenue**? Or do players have a fixed entertainment budget a month and **spending on skins substitutes spending on new gacha banners**? If players want to show how much they love a character, do they buy the skin or just C6 them?\n*Resource allocation* | Skins require labour hours to produce. Mihoyo is already a world leader for speed of the content releases and their design ambition. How much more can they take on? And even if they had spare labour capacity, would they rather make a few more skins or just make Natlan more epic? What's actually more important to them?\n*Character access: Skin target market* | Genshin's primary monetization is through restricting access to characters. This isn't compatible with a skins based approach. Restricting character access deliberately shrinks your skin audience. How many people are really going to buy a Ganyu skin if they don't own Ganyu?\n*Character access: Free Income* | Games with a heavier focus on skin monetization either have complete access to all characters (e.g. DotA), make it possible to grind out enough currency to unlock characters (e.g. LoL, Valorant), or have extremely generous free income (e.g. Azur Lane, GBF) precisely to solve the target market problem.\n*Social play* | Skins are more common in games with cooperative / social play because the skins provide social utility. *e.g. players in Fortnite who don\u2019t use cosmetics [get called \u201cDefault\u201d as an insult](https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/7/18534431/fortnite-rare-default-skins-bullying-harassment), etc.* However, Genshin's primary focus is a single player experience. **Skins therefore do not have the same social value to players**.\n*Client modification* | You can mod your game files locally to just reskin entire characters or replace them with new models such as [Chiori Ori](https://www.tiktok.com/@kudaranai4/video/7371106355815517473) (KR Duck pun). In a single player game with no social element, why pay for what you can just mod? (See also: Bethesda Horse Armour)\n\nThese factors imply that Mihoyo has a very clear design vision about what they want their product to be:\n\n* The core product is the open world and combat, and the vast majority of development resources go towards this;\n* Mihoyo has a single primary monetization vehicle (Characters and Weapons / Light Cones)  and this is sufficient for extracting money without requiring multiple channels to upsell players;\n* It\u2019s willing to say no to making more money if it means maintaining quality of everything else it produces (e.g. not splitting development resources)\n\nSo this is how we end up where we are here today in Genshin. A low volume pipeline of skins that are only ever released when paired with events, and with nearly half of them given away for free anyway.\n\nAnd Mihoyo is absolutely okay if you don't agree with this approach.\n\nThis is a consequence of having a very clear design vision and strong company leadership that says \u201cNo\u201d to things.\n\n###4e. The skins monetization trap\n\nSkins and cosmetics also contain an insidious trap when it comes to monetization.\n\nThe traditional thinking behind skins and cosmetics is that they are an easy to develop form of monetization that can exist outside of the core gameplay loop. This is only true up to a limit.\n\nRemember from Section 3 that game developers need to create reasons for people to pull for characters through game design. And in Section 3di I mentioned how players will eventually reach character saturation and no longer need to pull for as many characters on their account.\n\nIn many ways, the same is true for cosmetics. You might buy a skin for your favourite character or weapon. Maybe a second skin. But the fifth? Tenth? Twentieth?\n\nRemember the original revenue equation:\n\n> Revenue = Player Desire to Consume - Free Income\n\nCharacters are at least tied to gameplay. Therefore gameplay content can influence character sales. Pure cosmetics on the other hand cannot use this lever without becoming \u201cpay to win\u201d. The levers for manipulating the player\u2019s desire to consume are more limited.\n\nSkins also need to be distinct to draw spending and create the desire to consume. This in turn places pressure on your design vision. You start with benign changes, maybe breaking the colour palette for a character. But eventually you need to explore more options and start breaking things such as the character silhouette and readability. You introduce fancy effects like new animations or particles.\n\nThese new features also set sticky consumer expectations. Players will expect your new features such as particle effects, higher quality meshes and textures, etc. as the new standard of quality. This means that your cosmetics over time can only ever be monotonically increasing in quality. This in turn also drives up the cost of cosmetic development and erodes profits.\n\nEventually, as a developer you run out of options to get people to buy cosmetics. At this point, the customer base starts to segment:\n\n* Collectors and whales: Much higher satiety limits (e.g. the player that buys every Lux skin no matter what) and willing to pay higher price points as well;\n* Lower spenders: Players who are more sensitive to \u201cvalue\u201d and become satiated over time.\n\nA company therefore needs to both cultivate a population of collectors as well as offer them products to collect. And this is how you end up with League of Legends announcing a [430 USD commemorative in-game skin](https://old.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1d2luzd/the_signature_immortalized_legend_collection_is/).\n\nThis also means that your product is now pivoting toward catering to an explicitly smaller and narrower audience. And this has consequences for your priorities when it comes to what you choose to prioritize in product and feature development.\n\nThis is the trap when it comes to cosmetic monetization: Player satiation shrinks your customer base the same way that character releases can as well. And without the core gameplay loop offering levers to drive demand, satiety is much harder to break.\n\n##5. Conclusion\n\nSo what are the key lessons we have learned during this journey together?\n\n###Section 2. How does revenue even work for gacha companies?\n\n1. Revenue for gacha games is determined by\n  * **Revenue** = **Player Desire to Consume** (e.g. gacha / Resin refresh / BP / etc.) - **Free Income**\n2. **Free income acts as a subsidy for players** and should be **calibrated based on expected player elasticity of demand**;\n\n###Section 3. Game Design meets Monetization\n\n3. RPG gacha games cannot rely on traditional design tools because **the variation in power between players in a gacha game is too wide**;\n4. Game design must **rely on imposing restrictions** and these restrictions should synergize with the monetization approach of the game;\n5. For character driven games, **the rate of acceptable character releases is governed by how well your game supports excuses to pull for characters**;\n6. **Horniness is a unique factor to encourage player spending** but can only be utilised by niche games;\n\n###Section 4. Enshittification: When monetization goes wrong\n\n7. **Enshittification occurs when companies try to claim too much value** and don\u2019t leave enough value for players;\n8. **Enshittification can occur when companies track the wrong metrics** and erode consumer surplus by not properly understanding what they are doing;\n9. **Even well meaning monetization systems** that players themselves ask for **can lead to enshittification** due to erosion of value;\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading this essay as much as I enjoyed writing it.\n\nIf you have questions, please feel free to post in this Reddit thread.

        "Body/Content": "Hello everyone!\n\nOver the last week, I've been compiling a list of public figures who support Amber, either by putting out directly supportive statements, or interacting with supportive posts (such as on Instagram or Twitter). By request, I am posting this growing list here! It's a LOT longer than it was when I first started (it's grown since the morning, even), and I'm certain it'll keep growing. Please feel free to comment more names and I will add them when I can.

        "Body/Content": "I've seen time and again that people are falling into the trap of quickly jumping to conclusion even though a new character has only seen a few days of appearance and there hasn't been enough time to test everything yet, and jumping into the bandwagon of hating a character who eventually turns out to actually be good.\n\n* People were bashing that Childe is \"unplayable\" without C6. And yet as our knowledge improves, C6 is actually not an important constellation because the optimal way to play him is to rotate him anyway.\n* People on Honey Impact comments were saying that Kazuha was trash, dead on arrival, etc. when he was still in leaks. And yet we all know how amazing he turns out.\n* Similar thing with Raiden. She doesn't turn out to be secretly OP character, but reputable theorycrafters eventually conclude she's still a good character and perfectly usable at C0, only slightly lacking in flexibility compared to her more universal peers Venti and Zhongli.\n* Similarly with Raiden, Sara also does not turn out to be an amazing unit, but she's not trash as people memed. \n\nThis is particularly more the case when the character is not a straight main DPS and have a lot of moving parts (e.g. Raiden, Childe to some extent, Kazuha because he's a support). And lest we forget that in the game's very early life cycle Bennett and Sucrose were rated C tier and Xingqiu was merely B. It's more understandable since the game was very young at the time, but it still serves as an example.\n\nWhat I'm getting is, don't rush. Be patient. Let the theorycrafters do their thing. Banners run for 20 days and Abyss resets every 15 days. If you only want the unit for meta reasons (as opposed to preference or taste), you don't need to decide Day 1. \n\nEnjoy and have fun!",

        "Title": "Pyro Is Not Passion: What Vision Discourse Gets Wrong, Ambition, Ideals, and the Heavenly Principles",
        "Body/Content": "Visions and ideals. You've probably read about and speculated about this yourself. Each Archon stands for their own ideal, from Venti's love of freedom as a loafing bard, to the Tsaritsa's calculating approach to 'love' (as speculated by Dainseif's introduction of her in the Travails).\n\nPyro is passionate. Anemos have dead friends. Geo is determined. But we're thinking about this in the completely wrong way.\n\n**This is a post about Visions, why most 'Vision discourse' about character personalities/traits/ideals is fruitless, what I think they get wrong, and a new theory on ways to think about ambition, ideals, and the heavenly principles.**\n\n**Edit: If you reply with your headcanons about what personalities are connected to visions, congratulations on missing the point!** Please just make your own pyro is passion post and join the rest. \n\nWarning: Uses lines from Inazuma Archon Quest Act I (no story spoilers), about \\~5000 words long\n\nDisclaimer: I'm noob to Confucian theology (not that it's a huge point here), not 100% sure about the CN either, so pls feel free to correct. Genshin mixes influences, so there could very well be an alternative readings on divine principles and mortal pursuit... this is just one theory.\n\n# The issue with Vision discourse\n\nMost discussions go like this:\n\n**A**: Hydro is about connection to the divine. Mona's divination, Barbara as a deaconess, Childe and his servitude to the Tsaritsa, and Xingqiu continuing the Guhua clan's arts (who later ascended to Celestia), Kokomi and her god's legacy.**B:** Aren't some of those stretches?**A:** No, because\u2026\n\n*or*\n\n**B:** Couldn't it also be about dedication? Or about the mastery of their art?**A:** Well yes, but...\n\n*or*\n\n**B:** Hey, what about Hu Tao? She's continuing the Rite of Homa (or the modern version of it), the practices of Wangsheng, protects the border between life and death stricter than others, and essentially deals with the death of gods and adepti. You could even include her fame for poetry, and her reference to mortality against divinity.**A:** Hu Tao could never be Hydro, see...\n\nOr any other variant you can think of. It's fun to come up with these interpretations, but discourse often goes around in circles. But, thing is..\n\n# 1. We simply don't know enough\n\nHopefully to be addressed in the rest of the Archon Quests, Visions have simply been left vague. What little we know of Visions can be summarized as this:\n\n>Visions are external magical foci given to mortals as recognition from the gods, allowing them to channel elemental power. Vision bearers are called allogenes. ([Traveler's Vision Story](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Traveler/Story#Vision) & [Venti in Ending Note](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ending_Note))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**No one knows how they're given.** Some characters believe that their regional Archon grants Visions, regardless of element. [Klee's 'About the Vision'](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Klee/Voicelines) voiceline thanks Barbatos' for her Pyro Vision: \"This little marble is supposed to be a present from Barbatos to say well done?\". [Keqing](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Keqing/Voicelines) also credits Rex Lapis for her Electro one.Conversely, Baal was able to restrict Electro Visions. In [Act II's Prologue](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Crux_Clash_(Quest)), Kazuha speculates that the Seven Archons each have their own criteria for granting Visions. In [Endless Research](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Endless_Research), Alrani, a scholar from Sumeru Academia suggests that the lack of Electro Visions is due to \"the will of the Electro Archon\". Archons may have some degree of influence, but it being due to their 'will' remains unconfirmed.\n\nThe Traveler's Vision story tells us this:\n\n>\"Celestia is the realm of the gods, and the wielders of Visions walk the earth below. When they depart from this world, the chosen will ascend.\"\n\n...and Xiao's:\n\n>But do adepti receive their Visions as a form of acknowledgment from *Celestia*, like humans do?\n\nNote how these lines emphasize Celestia. This suggests that those in this abode have more influence than what commonfolk or even allogenes may think, especially given that they mostly attribute Visions to their Archons (Xiangling's \"I think the Archons agree with my passion, or else they wouldn't have given me this Vision\", Beidou's \"those with Visions are like flagships from the Archons to follow\", or Amber's \"My Vision... Is a sign that the Archons believe in me.\"). It could also mean that Archons are simply the last line of 'approval'.\n\nMona's story does remind us: \"The gods, too, are bound by the rules of this world.\"\n\n\u2026\n\n(I don't want to think about Vision casing. That's a mess.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2. Visions are connected to ambition or desire, weaker than ideals\n\nWith so much ambiguity on how Visions operate, we're left to extrapolate meaning from characters as unaware as we are (voicelines, quest dialogue) and our relatively objective source of truth: the Vision Story.\n\nHere, Visions are constantly referred to as a sign of recognition, favor, or witness.\n\n* [Diluc:](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Diluc/Story) \"...a Vision is simply an extension of their strength, a medium for channeling their willpower, a tribute to the experiences that have shaped them, and a testament to the story of their life so far.\"\n* Ganyu: \"Her Vision, then, was proof and witness of her new duty.\"\n* Bennett: \"Getting recognized by the gods\u2026\"\n* Hu Tao: \"...the ultimate recognition of her strength.\"\n* Rosaria: \"It witnesses me, and I witness it, that's all.\"\n* Mona: \"The people of this world consider \\[Visions\\] to be a sign of divine favor and the source of all power\u2026\"\n* Chongyun: \"...earned him the gods' favor\u2026\"\n\nAnd Visions themselves represent and come from desire/ambition (\u9858\u671b). Even more 'objective' sources, like Character Story narration (as opposed to character voiceovers) use this consistently:\n\n* Qiqi: \"...a desire to protect the past\"\n* Barbara: \"Everyone has their own desires. To bring together and fulfill those desires and make everyone happy \u2013 this is the purpose my Archon has bestowed upon me.\"\n* Ayaka: \"Visions are a seal of approval for those who are the most ambitious.\"\n* Diluc: \"...he took it as recognition by the gods of his and his father's shared ambition...\"\n* Yanfei: \"Visions appear in response to strong desire\u2026\"\n* Kazuha: \"It symbolizes the mortal desire to always keep moving forward\u2026\"\n* Xiao (an adeptus) literally has a line titled 'About the Vision: Desire\"; this line will be brought up again later: \"Visions? Desire? Ha. Do not judge adepti by your mortal ideals. I have no desire.\"\n\n(Examples taken from both Stories and Voicelines)\n\nIn Three Wishes, the Traveler states that touching the Thousand-Armed, Hundred-Eyed God's statue had them hear \"the sound of people's aspirations\". Thoma says \"that is where Visions come from... In other words, a person's Vision represents their ambition.\"\n\n**But ambition and desires are innately weaker than ideals.** An ideal is an apex of ambition or desire, a perfect standard of principles in full pursuit and precedence. Ambitions are merely yearnings, wishes, wants that require action. Visions represent 'mortal desire'.\n\nThe intentionality of this distinction is seen in the consistent word choice between ambition and ideals.\n\nMost telling is Zhongli's recall of Baal's fondest adage in the Fond Farewell:\n\n>EN: \"Seven ideals for seven gods, and of these, Eternity is nearest unto Heaven.\"CN: \u5728\u4e03\u795e\u8ffd\u5bfb\u7684\u4e03\u79cd\u7406\u5ff5\u4e2d\uff0c\u552f\u6709\u300e\u6c38\u6052\u300f\u6700\u63a5\u8fd1\u300e\u5929\u7406\u300f\u3002\u300dAmong the seven concepts pursued by the Seven Gods, only \"eternity\" is the closest to \"the law of heaven.\"\n\nThe ideal (\u7406\u60f3) seem to be used in reference to the beliefs of Archons and gods. During the Archon War, many gods struggled for these ideals.\n\n* In Treasure Lost, Treasure Found, Soraya mentions that the God of Dust Guizhong's ideals are still taught.\n* The Varunada Lazurite Gemstone narrated by the Hydro Archon: \"My ideals have no stains.\" (\u300c\u6211\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u4e4b\u5185\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u4e1d\u6c61\u6d4a\u3002)\n* The Divine Body from Guyun material is animated by the divine remains of lamenting gods, \"they are unrealized ideals, designs for a prosperous humanity that could never be.\"\n\nThis is supported by how each region's Archon seems to take on a new ideal as the seats are changed: the previous Dendro Archon was the God of the Woods, whereas the current one is the God of Wisdom. Archons are an ideal incarnate, but only in a vacuum could these ever be perfectly maintained.\n\nThe gods themselves, including the Archons, are constantly in pursuit of their ideals, hence Zhongli's line, \"seven concepts pursued by the Seven Gods\". It's not unfair to say that they do a much better job at adhering to these than mortals, especially their prime, but it's also unlikely personifications of such beliefs remain perfectly steadfast\u2013\u2013especially as the times change. (More on this later.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ideals vs the Heavenly Principles**\n\nThe same adage quoted by Zhongli makes specific use of \u5929\u7406 Tianli when referring to the 'law of heaven' in CN, \u5929\u7406 meaning heavenly principles or natural order. The prominence of this term is quite lost in English; in Confucianism, they are the universe's fundamental laws, unalterable by humans. Confucius believed that the heavens overruled human efforts, and was the \"supreme source of goodness\" who gave people tasks to perform to teach them virtues and morality. e.g., a region's welfare depends on the moral cultivation of its people, beginning from the nation's leadership. This could explain why beings close to the highest divine are directly entrusted with the \"burden of guiding humanity\", attempting to impart these virtues for their prosperity.\n\nIn the start of the game, the Unknown God introduces herself as **\u5929\u7406**\u7684\u7ef4\u7cfb\u8005 \"Maintainer of Heavenly Principles\", and the same term is used to talk about the Seven's ideals and ploys in the Travail video:\n\n* The God of Justice lives for the spectacle of the courtroom, seeking to judge all other gods. But even she understands one thing very well: the principles of heaven are not to be contested.\n* She is a god with no love left for her people, nor do they have any left for her. Her followers hope only to be on her side when the day of her rebellion against the principles of heaven comes at last.\n\nOur immanent (present in the material world) Archons are rulers set to guide humanity, while higher transcendental principles appear to be referred to here. Even in the context of the Seven, the \"heavenly principles\" are a more fundamental, higher level of order, positing the ideals of the gods/Archons below it\u2013\u2013which adds up. Think of it as heavenly principles > ideal > mortal ambition/desire.\n\nThe Sustainer of Heavenly Principles is threatened and 'fading away' (as in the Traveler's Character Details) for a reason:\n\n>EN: The keeper is fading away; the creator has not yet come.But the world shall burn no more, for you shall ascend.  \n>  \n>CN:  \u7ef4\u7cfb\u8005\u6b63\u5728\u6b7b\u53bb,\u521b\u9020\u8005\u5c1a\u672a\u5230\u6765\u3002\u4f46\u4e16\u754c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u518d\u5ea6\u707c\u70e7, \u56e0\u4e3a\u4f60\u5c06\u767b\u4e0a \uff62\u795e\uff63 \u4e4b\u5ea7\u3002The Sustainer is dying, the creator has yet to come. But the world will not burn again, because you will ascend to the seat of \uff62God\uff63.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat now when the God of Contracts has signed a contract to end all contracts himself? Or the means of Baal's frantic, oppressive rule of eternity? If Archons themselves struggle to ensnare themselves in these concepts, what more finicky humans in a tumultuous world?\n\n# \n\n# 3. Visions recognize a moment's ambition\n\nSo what then is the issue with how people interpret why mortals are favored with Visions of certain elemental types? It's simply that this recognition can occur with any facet of one's character: there is no singular, one desire or ambition that one can embody\u2013\u2013they are lesser than ideals. These are fleeting, frequently imperfect characterizations of our cast\u2013\u2013putting people together in Anemo = \\[trait\\] *alone* will always have flaws, which just means good writing. **The gods recognize one of many desires**, **and this particular happens in a particular moment.**\n\nThis is heavily alluded to in Chongyun's story\u2013\u2013which outright says that he could have easily been 'Pyro'\u2013\u2013questioning the *goal* (we can take this as similar to an ambition) in response to his Cryo Vision being given.\n\n>...Perhaps it was this resolve that earned him the gods' favor \u2014 that said, the Vision granted to Chongyun was one of \"Cryo\" rather than \"Pyro.\"  \n>  \n>As to which of his goals it was the Vision responded to, that is also a mystery.\n\nIt's critical to realize that Visions seem to respond to *specific* moments of ambition and will. Our Traveler's story says this explicitly:\n\n>When faced with circumstances that they cannot control, humans often bemoan their powerlessness.  \n>  \n>But if a person is found to have surpassing ambition even as their life reaches such a **desperate turning point**, then the gods would look upon them with favor.  \n>  \n>\u2026***Is it wise to allow a moment's ambition to dominate one's entire life?***\n\nThis 'domination' could refer to the reliance on Visions that bearers find themselves held to, or more abstractly, the psychological costs and trade-offs they live with.\n\nZhongli further stresses that Visions appear during a 'fateful moment' in [the Fond Farewell](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/The_Fond_Farewell).\n\n>But if a person shows true strength of will at a desperate and fateful moment in their life, the gods will look upon them with favour.\n\nCould the receipt of a Vision be something written in fate, or one that changes their fate? Kun Jun mentions that \" fate is ordained by heaven\". Just as the Archons go about ruling their people in different ways, the question as to how Visions as an instrument are used by higher gods remains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Vision Stories**\n\nChongyun's story is a direct questioning, and it's wholly possible for moments of will to be unknown to us, such as *for characters without revealed Vision stories*.\n\nThere are three broad classifications for the 'narratives' present in Vision stories, helping us know how accurately we can class people\u2013\u2013if it's still worth it at all.\n\nMost characters like Diona are straightforward: during a storm, she unknowingly froze over water in her path while tracking her father using her Cryo Vision. Chongyun is more ambiguous and theoretical\u2013\u2013talking about conflict with his yang energy & exorcism career but no specific moment. Other stories have no mention at all, talk about conflict after a Vision: Childe's is about his Delusion and Xingqiu's on his Guhua practices after receiving the Vision.\n\nThe categories and some characters that fall under them. Sorry, you'll have to open your game or the wiki:\n\n* **Defined** (describes precise moment; answers several who/what/why/where):Qiqi, Beidou, Hu Tao, Bennett, Barbara\n* **Ambiguous** (talks more ambiguously about traits that could have kindled Vision):Chongyun, Xiangling, Diluc\n* **???** (not mentioned at all, post-Vision)\\*\\*:\\*\\*Childe, Xingqiu, Keqing (just about her trying to destroy it, vibe)\n\nThis means that **it can be pretty arbitrary.** So take: if Bennett or Hu Tao's story in the third category, it would be harder to place them. Without knowledge of Bennett being seconds away from dying, or Hu Tao trekking to the border and waiting, we'd only go off their broad character\u2013\u2013which doesn't always give off the best guess of how they'd canonically act in some of the most pivotal moments of their life.It could also just be a MiHoYo thing: X character sells well as Pyro/Cryo, the most desirable DPS elements, so a story is made to justify that when it could fall into any other, or that story is clumped into Pyro/Cryo.\n\nThe point about these moments is that they often happen in \"fateful\" circumstances beyond their control. Extremes of a human person that we can only make guesses on unless written out for us. Or convenient moments that are honed in on for plot/gameplay reasons.\n\nAs a counterpoint, we do have characters who've received their Visions in more 'mundane' moments, doing their regular tasks\u2013\u2013nothing desperate about the moment. Perhaps it was just that in this moment that the gods finally decided to look upon them? Mona's indwelling the teaching aid given to her by her master, Sucrose just plopping her new Vision into a cauldron on \"an afternoon like any other\", Albedo giving his a single glance before carrying on with his research\u2026\n\nLisa's seemingly mundane Vision story also holds a lot of implications about her relationship with knowledge, the divine, and cost of Visions. I count this separately even if it seems similar to the other three:\n\n>\"Hmm... I suppose I shall need a Vision, then.\"  \n>  \n>And just like that, as that thought popped into her mind, her Vision popped into her hand.  \n>  \n>\u2026With the aid of her Vision, Lisa acquired the knowledge that she sought. But she also sensed the deep secret hidden in the shadows of that knowledge.  \n>  \n>For whatever reasons, the gods gave humans the key to changing everything, but they did not explain the cost involved. Lisa grew fearful of the truth.  \n>  \n>The Vision that hung from her neck became to her a bottomless pit filled with sweet delights, lingering at the back of her mind.\n\n...\n\nIf you subscribe to the theory that gods grant Visions to influence a person's life trajectory (in similar vein to how constellations \"[determine the shape of one's character](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Tusk_of_Monoceros_Caeli)\" and map out Vision bearer's destinies), then this supports that. The gods stepping in to save Bennett from death, divine recognition intervening in the crossfire that resulted in Qiqi's mortal wounds that let the adepti breathe life back into her, Diona's struggles with her Cryo Vision, or Keqing's worldview about divinity changing\u2026\n\n\"Visions\u2026 are also a type of contract. You should know that all power comes at a price. For every bit of power you gain, so too do you gain more responsibility.\" Zhongli mentions. As much as people reject or try to avoid using their Visions, its influence lingers.\n\nSuch that a moment's thought could then influence a Vision wielder's whole life\u2013\u2013depending on how reliant they are to the elemental focus\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 4. Divine ideals should be looked at distinctly from human ideals\n\nThis point is the least strong, most subjective, and most speculative.\n\nEarlier, we established that the Seven themselves are subject to higher heavenly principles (maintained by the Sustainer of Heavenly Principles), with roots in Confucianism. Herein Confucian theology, \"God has not created man in order to neglect him, but is always with man, and sustains the order of nature and human society, by teaching rulers how to be good to secure the peace of the countries.\" In realizing one's humanity, they become one with heaven by the contemplation of the order of creation and the source of divine authority.\n\nSimilarly, in Valentinianism, *gnosis* is about insight into the true nature of humanity, a path of salvation leading them into celestial existence.\n\nThis distinction between man and god even operates on the level of the adepti. In [Xiao's Developer Notes](https://www.hoyolab.com/genshin/article/180703), we learn that \"humans have a higher purpose than adepti\"; meanwhile for illuminated beasts like Xiao, an 'inner eye' serves as the true source of power and Visions are only worn to \"comply with the expected norm.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"Visions? Desire? Ha. Do not judge adepti by your *mortal* ideals. I have no desire.\"\n\nWhen Xiao's in Voicelines we inquire about Visions and desire, he shrugs the Traveler off. Clearly he has his own objectives and is generally cold in his lines, but the interesting part is the measure of *mortal ideals*. This is close to the CN text as well, saying \"don't use mortal standards to speculate about immortals.\"\n\nCoupled with the idea that mortal desire only goes so far, that Archons rule their nation with ideals they've enkindled even before the gnosis (assuming they were gods), and how the highest heavenly principles themselves are untouchable by man\u2013\u2013there must be an order inherently unreachable. Our mortal cast, recognized by the divine, in reach of only so much.\n\nIn the beginning of the Travail, Dainsleif mentions this. I'd like to highlight the emphasis on 'desire', references to Visions and how they appear to be a doorway to divinity:\n\n>EN: The gods goad us on with the promise of their seven treasures, rewards for the worthy, the doorway to divinity. Yet buried in the depths of this world lies smoldering remains, a warning to those that dare trespass.CN: \u6218\u4e89\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f00\u59cb\u4e86\uff0c\u662f\u4e0a\u4e00\u573a\u6218\u4e89\u7684\u5ef6\u7eed\u3002\u4f17\u795e\u4e3a\u6b32\u671b\u7684\u8f6e\u5ed3\u9540\u4e0a\u4e03\u79cd\u5149\u8f89\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u662d\u793a\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6743\u67c4\u53ef\u88ab\u4f01\u53ca\u3002\u800c\u73b0\u4e16\u7684\u57fa\u5e95\u57cb\u85cf\u7740\u9634\u71c3\u7684\u6b8b\u9ab8\uff0c\u90a3\u662f\u5bf9\u50ed\u8d8a\u8005\u7684\u8b66\u793a...  \n>  \n>\"The goads gild the contours of desire with seven lights of radiance; by this method, you may touch their power. But the smouldering ruins buried in the deepest foundations of the world are a warning to those who trespass\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Mortal belief vs the gods**\n\nGods stand for specific divine ideals that are laid out pretty broadly, which is why there's so much overlap and contention in the first place. Naturally, from their 'perfected' ideal come philosophies and teachings that their region emulates, which are our talent books.\n\nThis section focuses less on gameplay observations (i.e. nowhere does this insinuate that talent books are actually consumed regularly to gain power, just as how we do not pick up thousands of Crimson Witch pieces in actuality), and are more concerned with the implications of their flavor text.\n\nWe do know that talent books have canonical basis, as in [Yanfei's 2021 birthday letter](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Birthday/Yanfei):\n\n>\"Here, take this Guide to Prosperity. No matter where you venture off to, don't forget what people pursue in the land of Geo.\"\n\n*What people pursue*. Potentially influenced by the gods' ideals (either the original Seven or current) but still a pursuit adapted by humans later on. We have no information about the origin of books themselves. Nevertheless, these 'teachings', 'guides', and 'philosophies' do seem to be the work of people from each nation sharing their form, foundation, yearnings, symbols from their experiences in their region and their Archon's method of presence:\n\n* **Freedom:** Freedom is the spirit of the city of wind. To sing is one such freedom. To sing on the land created by the Anemo Archon is to send your heart away with the song on the wind.\n* **Resistance:** Resistance is the backbone of the Land of the Wind. The history of Mondstadt is one of resistances. People rose up to allow the future Mondstadt's poetry to freely be that of the wind and be spread across the land.\n* **Ballad:** Poetry is the soul of the Land of the Wind. Poetry is the manifestations of the desire to spread the word. Though nothing is eternal, though nothing will be the same, the wind's poetry will still spread beyond the skies, the land, the seas, to every corner of the world.\n\n...and so on for Liyue and Inazuma. While Mondstadt has a book for 'Freedom'\u2013\u2013their divine ideal\u2013\u2013there are no 'Contract' or 'Eternity' books.\n\nThere's good reason for this though, as these 'teachings' and 'philosophies' seem to vie with the Archon's beliefs themselves, just as contradictions fill our Archon's actions in the events of the story. Not every god is fit to rule. The [Boreal Wolf](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Boreal_Wolf%27s_Nostalgia) [materials](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Boreal_Wolf%27s_Milk_Tooth) tell us that Andrius deemed himself unworthy of becoming the Anemo Archon as he was unable to envision a happy life for humanity, lacking the gods' responsibility to \"love all people\".\n\nThe conflict with the Raiden Shogun showcases how her idea and pursuit of 'Eternity' has cast Inazuma into a dangerous state. Inazuma's books in particular seem to voice out the concerns of the region's mortals, with flavor text narrated as them, \"we mortals\":\n\n>Transience is the dream of the nation of thunder.  \n>  \n>Fleeting glories are the highest expression of mortal beauty, for **are we mortals** not like the flashing lightning itself? Like a lovely dream or blossoming spark, we shall leave a gorgeous mark on the eternal night sky.\n\nOne could say that these books reflect the ideals of the original Seven, but I'd wager that these are malleable, more likely penned by man to be reflective of present-day (such that the Inazuma books directly discuss Baal's dream of 'Eternity': \"The ruler who claims to have perceived all forever aims to hoard celestial glory\u2026\").\n\nWhile each Archon imposes their own systems of belief as embodiments of their ideal, human purpose is higher. Mortal ambition far more diverse, rarely contained regardless of how realized they may become.\n\nTalent books reflect this mortal perspective on what flourishes, in forms that can contrast with what their god imposes.\n\nMondstadt's storyline directly deals with the conflict between Freedom, and in a higher level, what happens when an Archon's ideals are imposed:\n\n>EN: What does freedom really mean, when demanded of you by a god?CN:\u88ab\u300c\u81ea\u7531\u300d\u4e4b\u795e\u547d\u4ee4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u79f0\u4e4b\u4e3a\u81ea\u7531\u5417\uff1fA freedom dictated by the God of Freedom, can it really be named freedom?\n\nGoing back to the concept of 'moral cultivation', it appears as if Mondstadt will never actualize this with the presence of divinity. (This can depend on your personal interpretation on how 'free' Mondstadt is, and if freedom can truly be achieved under the current laws of Teyvat and system of the Seven.) What is freedom after all, when demanded by a god? Self-cultivation out of one's efforts requires a more deliberate process, as if the provision of Visions directly counteracts this objective. Divine tools that attempt to induct ideals only go so far.\n\nAnd Liyue's, a \"contract to end all contracts\", presumably Zhongli reneging on his initial contract with Celestia:\n\n>EN: In the end, he will sign the contract to end all contracts.CN: \u5728\u6700\u540e\u7684\u65f6\u523b\uff0c\u4ed6\u5c06\u7b7e\u8ba2\u7ec8\u7ed3\u4e00\u5207\u5951\u7ea6\u7684\u5951\u7ea6At the last moment, he signs the contract that shall end all contracts.\n\nThis doesn't mean that Venti or Zhongli don't believe in their ideal at all; freedom still paves the lives of many Mondstadians (\"Me not wanting you to listen to the Abyss Order doesn't mean that you have to listen to me\"), and Liyue's own people forge their own contracts and agreements that have led them to prosper.\n\nLetting go of the rigidity of these ideals under divine rule, however, seems to be a common theme. In turn, people forge their own beliefs. These own ambitions and values may contradict that of their Archons. Like with their talent books, Inazuma's Travails questions Baal's pursuit of Eternity:\n\n>EN: \"But what do mortals see of the eternity chased after by their god?\"CN: \u8ffd\u6c42\u300c\u6c38\u6052\u300d\u4e4b\u795e\uff0c\u5728\u4e16\u4eba\u773c\u4e2d\u89c1\u5230\u4e86\u600e\u6837\u7684\u6c38\u6052\uff1f\"What kind of eternity will the God pursuing Eternity see through the eyes of mortals?\"\n\n(However, something interesting to note is that Venti and Zhongli hold English \\_\\_\\_ Dei Constellations (Divine Stone/Divine Song) while Baal is instead Imperatix Umbrosa (similar to Shadowy Empress/Empress of the Shadows). In CN, Baal's constellation is \u5929\u4e0b\u4eba\u5ea7 \"The One Who Will Unite and Rule the World\". Translated directly, \u5929\u4e0b\u4eba is meant to be a title for a *human*, not a deity...)\n\nWe also know of Khaenri'ah who flourished as the \"pride of humanity\" without any god at all. The immanent Archons manifest their ideals in new forms. The heavenly principles that appear to hold the world together fading. Are divine ideals necessary for mankind to prosper?\n\n...\n\n(Don't make assignments with talent books! If it wasn't clear enough. It's important to remember that like elements, these assignments are also not really based on any definitive identity. You can easily make a case for a character to fall under *any* book. For gameplay reasons, people are spread out evenly amongst their region's three books. With exceptions like Kazuha introduced pre-Inazuma and Tartaglia with Mondstadt books\u2013\u2013things get a bit funky.)\n\n# 5. Ideals can overlap, and they should\n\nGiven that humans seem to be driven by desire that can be anything from fleeting to ruthlessly pursued, and that humans have the inherent ability to just\u2013\u2013*believe in many things* as they're not the personification of any one trait\u2026 they cannot be contained.  Our cast is rich and complex.\n\nAt the time of writing, we're far away from completing many characters' Story Quest series, and have people who have yet to be seen. We receive bits of characterization in everything from furniture lore to birthday tweets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Seven ever-changing classifications will always be broad**\n\nThere's direct conflict between the embodiment of one 'ideal' and human complexity/purpose.\n\nAfter all, before the time of the Seven and in regions beyond Teyvat, people flourished without being clumped into seven ideals. Human ambition and desire, even unguided by divinity, is insatiable. Perhaps even arrogant at times. Could this be related to the mortal arrogation that the Sustainer of Heavenly Principles fears? And what in truth, does *gnosis* mean?\n\nI can imagine the Archons at war with the right moment to grant a character of a specific Vision. If we had a more binary classification system, things would be a little easier; but like the 'seven deadly sins' and how you & I could likely tick off more than a few and perhaps one stronger depending on time of day, our guesses can only go as far as the information we're given with characters who actually have Vision stories. Trying to play with anything else is just like writing fanfiction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A case could be made for a character and most elements, really**\n\nWe do still have a mysterious 'criteria' and unknown motives for the provision of Visions themselves. So valid discourse might be like: \"X and Y shares this trait that seems to fall under this Archon's ideal\", but something less productive would be \"What about Z? They could also have that trait, so X and Y exhibiting that would be meaningless\"\u2013\u2013since it's totally possible. A non-Anemo person exhibiting Anemo similarities won't erase the connection. There's naturally going to be overlap and conflict when dealing with assignments for seven ideals and a cast of dozens of complex characters.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n* Vision discourse is founded on the wrong things: tracing people to abstract divine ideals that are themselves questioned and flawed, and operate on different principles than the ambitions/desires that mortals concern themselves with\n* Visions recognize mortal desire or ambition, of which one can have many, that are often far less realized than a god's ideals.\n   * Language associates mortals = desire/ambition, gods = ideals\n   * Desire/ambition are regarded as lesser ideals.\n   * The past (Archon War) and present (God of Contracts signing the 'contract to end all contracts', Baal) display the irony of the gods' own pursued ideals.\n* Recognition comes at specific moments, which we have no information at all on for some characters. (The decision might even be pretty arbitrary, such as for gameplay, what sells $$$,)\n* Under Confucian belief, welfare is related to moral cultivation from a nation's leadership; hence the Seven are entrusted with the \"burden of guiding humanity\" under a divine ideal\n* The Archons themselves are contradicting their own rigid beliefs, the Sustainer is dying.\n* Mortal desire is more varied than heavenly desire; an order of heavenly principles > ideal > mortal ambition/desire\n\nAfter all, is it wise to allow a moment's ambition to dominate one's entire life?\n\n...\n\nThanks for reading!

There have been plenty of well-reasoned [arguments](https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p082825) and data-driven [studies](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B) that the U.S. is ruled by an oligarchy of the wealthiest 1% of Americans and top business interests. Less-acknowledged is the obvious oligarchy right before our faces: Nine individuals appointed to lifetime positions on the highest court of the land with virtually unlimited power over the 330 million people in the country. Eight out of the nine attended an Ivy League school and all have a net worth of over a million dollars, with the portfolios of four exceeding five million dollars.\n\nWe can ask how nine people ended up with control over the lives of hundreds of millions but the answer is, again, the rule over the many by the few. Despite being called \u201cthe greatest deliberative body in the world,\u201d the U.S. Senate is undemocratic and biased in structure. The fact that each state gets two senators, no matter the population of said state, violates important democratic norms like majority rule, fair representation, and one-person/one-vote. California\u2019s 40 million residents get to elect two senators, but the state right next door, Nevada, gets the exact same representation for 3 million residents. A vote in Nevada is worth 13 times as much as a vote in California.\n\nThe result of misrepresentation in the Senate is a bias towards small population states, which tend to be overwhelmingly rural, white and conservative. Over-representing these small states means over-representing the Republican party. On average, each Democratic senator in the 2018 midterms won [30% more votes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-us-is-in-a-state-of-perpetual-minority-rule/2018/11/08/9f9f38a0-e2b1-11e8-8f5f-a55347f48762_story.html) than each Republican senator. Yet, the Republican party controlled the Senate 53-47. At its worst, the Senate\u2019s structure enables residents of the smallest population states that represent only 17% of the U.S. to elect 51 senators and rule over 83% of us. The existence of the filibuster only deepens minority rule: 42 senators from the smallest states representing only 10% of the population can block legislation favored by 90% of America.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s minority rule leads directly to the Supreme Court\u2019s super-minority rule. Less-populated conservative states have much more say over who is confirmed to the most powerful body in the nation, with the ability to review and declare unconstitutional both executive and legislative policies. For example, the Senate Republicans who blocked President Obama\u2019s nominee to the Court, Merrick Garland, [represented](https://archive.thinkprogress.org/the-unprecedented-illegitimacy-of-the-roberts-court-086dde8373bf/) 20 million fewer people than the Democrats who supported him. Neil Gorsuch, President Trump\u2019s first Supreme Court nominee, was opposed by 45 Democratic Senators representing 25 million more Americans than the 55 Republican Senators who supported him. Brett Kavanaugh was approved by Senators who [represented](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/06/senators-representing-less-than-half-us-are-about-confirm-nominee-opposed-by-most-americans/) only 44% of the American public and Amy Coney Barrett was approved by Senators [representing](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/10/21/fact-check-minority-rule-post-has-6-true-facts-trump-barrett/3669988001/) 14 million fewer Americans than those opposing her.\n\nThe power of minority rule goes farther than the Senate: Five out of the nine justices were appointed by presidents that lost the popular vote. Chief Justice Roberts and Samuel Alito were appointed by George W. Bush, who lost the popular vote in 2000 (and only won the election [thanks to](https://scholars.law.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1508&context=nlj) the Supreme Court). Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett were appointed by Donald Trump, who won the 2016 election despite losing by over 2.8 million votes. The ascension of unpopular presidents is a result of the Electoral College, which violates the \u2018majority rules\u2019 principle of democratic elections and allows a specific few states, called battleground states, to dominate the electoral process. \n\nIn sum, every step of becoming a Supreme Court justice is determined by a minority of voters. From the president who chooses the nominee to the Senate who confirms a justice to the bench. These justices then have unparalleled power to determine the rights 330 million Americans have\u2014and, crucially, the rights we do not have. \n\n---\n---\n\n#VOTING RIGHTS AND GERRYMANDERING\n\nWith the release of the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, the logical place to start answering how we got here is voting rights. Why? Because, as Justice Samuel Alito wrote, Dobbs \u201creturn[s] the issue of abortion to the people\u2019s elected representatives.\u201d This would be true if the elected representatives weren\u2019t given the green light by the Supreme Court to rig the game, preventing the full electorate from showing them the door. State legislatures can choose their voters, can oppress the opposition, and ensure that they are not representative of the population as a result.\n\n##Voting laws\n\n[Crawford v. Marion County Election Board](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-21.pdf) (2008): The Supreme Court voted 6-3 to uphold voter ID laws as constitutional. Justice John Paul Stevens (Ford appointee) wrote for the plurality that Indiana's legitimate state interest in preventing voter fraud outweighed the burden on voters\u2019 right to vote. Justice David Souter, joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, dissented, arguing that Indiana had the burden of producing actual evidence of the existence of fraud, something he felt the state did not accomplish.\n\n[Shelby County v. Holder](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-96_6k47.pdf) (2013): The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 to throw out the formula that determines which states must have changes to voting procedures cleared by the Department of Justice. Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority, claimed that \u201cno one can fairly say that it shows anything approaching the 'pervasive,' 'flagrant,' 'widespread,' and 'rampant' discrimination that faced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions from the rest of the nation.\" Justice Ginsburg, joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, wrote that \"[t]hrowing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.\"\n\n>[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/07/how-shelby-county-broke-america/564707/): The results have been predictable. Voter-identification laws, which experts suggest will make voting harder especially for poor people, people of color, and elderly people, have advanced in several states, and some voting laws that make it easier to register and cast ballots have been destroyed. For many of the jurisdictions formerly under preclearance, voting became rapidly more difficult after the Shelby County decision, particularly for poor and elderly black people and Latinos\u2026looking deeper, it might be even more appropriate to say that the Shelby County v. Holder decision committed violence against the Fourteenth Amendment itself, of which the Voting Rights Act is a distant descendant.\n\n[Husted v. Randolph Institute](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-980_f2q3.pdf) (2018): The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 upholding the practice of [voter caging](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/guide-voter-caging), where a locality sends mass direct mailings to registered voters and purges those whose mailing is returned undeliverable. The law, as Justice Sotomayor notes in her dissent, \u201cdisproportionately affected minority, low-income, disabled, and veteran voters.\u201d\n\n[Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-1257_g204.pdf) (2021): The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to uphold regu\u00adla\u00adtions requir\u00ading out-of-precinct ballots to be entirely discarded and prohibiting anyone but a voter\u2019s family member or care\u00adgiver from return\u00ading early ballots for another person. In doing so, the Court rewrote the law that applies to lawsuits under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, focus\u00ading on factors never before considered in these cases, such as whether a state provides more oppor\u00adtun\u00adit\u00adies to vote now than most states did when Section 2 was last amended in 1982. This means it will be even more diffi\u00adcult for voting rights advoc\u00adates to chal\u00adlenge discrim\u00adin\u00adat\u00adory voting laws. \n\n>Justice Kagan, dissent: \"What is tragic here is that the Court has (yet again) rewritten \u2014 in order to weaken \u2014 a statute that stands as a monument to America's greatness, and protects against its basest impulses. What is tragic is that the Court has damaged a statute designed to bring about 'the end of discrimination in voting.'\"\n\n##Gerrymandering\n\n[Abbott v. Perez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_v._Perez) (2018): The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 to overturn both trial and appellate court findings that Texas\u2019 2010-cycle redistricting maps violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) by diluting minority votes and using racial gerrymandering to define the new districts. In doing so, the Court reworked the process for determining violations of Section 2 of the VRA, making the voters prove that \u201cthe legislature intended to discriminate when it enacted the current plan.\"\n\n>Justice Sotomayor, dissent: [The majority\u2019s] disregard of both precedent and fact comes at serious costs to our democracy. It means that, after years of litigation and undeniable proof of intentional discrimination, minority voters in Texas\u2014despite constituting a majority of the population within the State\u2014will continue\nto be underrepresented in the political process. \n\n[Rucho v. Common Cause](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-422_9ol1.pdf) (2018): The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that \"partisan gerrymandering claims present political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts.\u201d Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority, said that individual states have the power to decide whether partisan gerrymandering is allowed. Justice Kagan, joined by Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayer, dissented: \u201cOf all times to abandon the Court's duty to declare the law, this was not the one. The practices challenged in these cases imperil our system of government.\u201d\n\n[Merrill v. Milligan](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21a375_d18f.pdf) (2022): The Supreme Court issued a 5-4 shadow docket order allowing Alabama to use maps for the 2022 election that lower courts found to be unconstitutionally racially gerrymandered. In doing so, the Court invoked the Purcell principle to reason that four months away from a primary election is not enough time for state legislatures to draft new maps.\n\n---\n---\n\n#CAMPAIGN FINANCE\n\n[Citizens United v. FEC](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2008/08-205) (2010): The most consequential Supreme Court ruling, perhaps in American political history, came in the form of 2010\u2019s Citizens United v. Federal Elec\u00adtion Commis\u00adsion. Citizens United, a conservative non-profit organization, sought to air and advertise a film critical of then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton ahead of the 2008 primary. Advertising the film would have been a violation of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, so the organization filed a lawsuit to challenge the law. \n\nA 5-4 major\u00adity of the Supreme Court sided with Citizens United, ruling that corpor\u00ada\u00adtions and other outside groups can spend unlim\u00adited money on elec\u00adtions. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, found that limit\u00ading \u201cinde\u00adpend\u00adent polit\u00adical spend\u00ading\u201d from corpor\u00ada\u00adtions and other groups viol\u00adates the First Amend\u00adment right to free speech. In the process, the Court overturned Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990), which had allowed different restrictions on speech-related spending based on corporate identity, as well as a portion of McConnell v. FEC (2003) that had restricted corporate spending on electioneering communications. \n\n>[Columbia University Magazine](https://magazine.columbia.edu/article/how-citizens-united-changed-our-politics): Who has benefited from the influx of cash? Overwhelmingly, the Republican Party, according to new research by Columbia political scientist Carlo Prato\u2026the researchers found that in the twenty-three states that formerly restricted corporate and union political spending, Republicans have won a three-to-four-point greater share of the vote since 2010 than would otherwise have been expected, given national voting trends. Not surprisingly, this appears to have won the GOP many tight races: the party\u2019s share of legislative seats in these states has jumped by an average of 5 percent.\n\n[Arizona Free Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-238.pdf) (2011): The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 against campaign finance laws that supplement publicly financed candidates once they were outspent by privately financed opponents. \"Arizona's matching funds scheme substantially burdens political speech,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts wrote for the majority.\n\n[McCutcheon v. FEC](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-536_e1pf.pdf) (2013): The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 to abolish aggregate federal campaign contributions. Before the ruling, individuals were prohibited from giving more than $48,600 combined to all federal candidates and, also, prohibited from giving more than $74,600 combined to all parties and political action committees. Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority, stated that \"the government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may endorse.\"\n\n>Justice Breyer, dissent: The court\u2019s opinion \"creates a loophole that will allow a single individual to contribute millions of dollars to a political party or to a candidate's campaign. Taken together with Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm'n, 558 U. S. 310 (2010), today's decision eviscerates our Nation's campaign finance laws, leaving a remnant incapable of dealing with the grave problems of democratic legitimacy that those laws were intended to resolve.\"\n\n---\n---\n\n#RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE\n\nIn the hands of modern conservatives, \u201creligious freedom\u201d has morphed from the right of all Americans to worship freely under a neutral government into a phrase that connotes rights only for the Christian faith. No longer is religion kept separate from the state; it is used as cover to allow discrimination against any individuals and causes that the Christian faith finds objectionable or distasteful. \n\n[Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf) (2013): The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that employers cannot be required to cover contraceptives like Plan B and hormonal IUDs for their female employees. Justice Alito, writing for the majority, reasoned that \u201cprotecting the free-exercise rights of corporations\u2026protects the religious liberty of the humans who own and control these companies.\u201d Justice Ginsburg, joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, noted that \u201c[u]ntil this litigation, no decision of this Court recognized a for-profit corporation\u2019s qualification for a religious exemption from a generally applicable law,\u201d and that such an exemption in this case would \u201cdeny legions of women who do not hold their employers\u2019 beliefs access to contraceptive coverage.\u201d\n\n[Town of Greece v. Galloway](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-696_bpm1.pdf) (2014): The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that town governments may open meetings with religious prayer as long as the practice is consistent with the tradition long followed by Congress and state legislatures. Justice Kagan, in dissent, wrote that the town\u2019s practice of focusing almost exclusively on Christian ministers violated the \u201cFirst Amendment\u2019s promise that every citizen, irrespective of her religion, owns an equal share in her government.\"\n\n[Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-111_j4el.pdf) (2018): The Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission expressed impermissible hostility to religion by questioning \u201cthe sincere religious beliefs\u201d of a baker who refused to create a cake for a same-sex wedding. \n\n>[Erwin Chemerinsky, in the American Bar Association\u2019s Human Rights Magazine](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/crsj/publications/human_rights_magazine_home/the-ongoing-challenge-to-define-free-speech/not-a-masterpiece/): \u2026for decades, the law has made the choice that ensuring equality is worth sacrificing the liberty to discriminate. Put in constitutional terms, ending discrimination is a compelling government interest. Enforcing antidiscrimination laws thus should not be seen as a violation of free exercise of religion or freedom of speech.\n\n[American Legion v. American Humanist Association](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-1717_4f14.pdf) (2018): The Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that longstanding religious monuments\u2014specifically a World War I memorial cross on government land\u2014do not violate the Establishment Clause because they may have had a secular original purpose. \u201cThat the cross originated as a Christian symbol and retains that meaning in many contexts does not change the fact that the symbol took on an added secular meaning when used in World War I memorials,\u201d Justice Alito wrote for the majority. Justice Ginsburg wrote in the dissent that the Peace Cross unconstitutionally \u201celevates Christianity over other faiths, and religion over non religion.\u201d\n\n[Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-1195_g314.pdf) (2020): The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that religious schools cannot be excluded from school choice programs. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is perverse, Sotomayor wrote in the dissent. \u201cWithout any need or power to do so, the Court appears to require a State to reinstate a tax-credit program that the Constitution did not demand in\nthe first place.\u201d\n\n---\n---\n\n#CIVIL RIGHTS AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE\n\n[Connick v. Thompson](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-571.pdf) (2011): The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that prosecutors cannot be held liable for damages when they violate the law to deprive a person of a fair trial. The case involved John Thompson, an African American father of two who was wrongfully convicted of robbery and murder due to the prosecutor\u2019s office hiding a blood test that proved his innocence. After nearly two decades of wrongfully being imprisoned, Thompson was released and sued the district attorney, winning $14 million. Justice Thomas, writing for the majority, overturned the award by arguing that there was no evidence of a pattern of misconduct.\n\n[Salinas v. Texas](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-246_7l48.pdf) (2013): The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that a person under police questioning must expressly invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege; otherwise, prosecutors can use a person\u2019s silence during questioning as \u201cproof\u201d of their guilt. Justice Breyer, writing for the dissent, noted that the Court has previously held that \u201cno ritualistic\nformula is necessary in order to invoke the privilege.\u201d Breyer continued, \u201cHow can an individual who is\nnot a lawyer know that these particular words are legally magic?\u201d\n\n[Heien v. North Carolina](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-604_ec8f.pdf) (2014): The Supreme Court ruled 8-1 that police officers who make \u201creasonable\u201d mistakes of law and conduct searches on that basis do not violate the Fourth Amendment. In the case, a police officer claimed to believe that a single broken brake light was reason to institute a traffic stop in North Carolina, which then led to a search of the vehicle and drug charges. State law, in reality, did not hold that a single dysfunctional brake light was a traffic violation. \n\n[Utah v. Strieff](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/14-1373_83i7.pdf) (2016): The Supreme Court ruled 5-3 that evidence obtained from an unlawful police stop cannot be excluded from court when the unlawful stop led to the discovery of an outstanding warrant. Justice Sotomayor dissented, writing \u201cthis case tells everyone, white and black, guilty and innocent, that an officer can verify your legal status at any time. It says that your body is subject to invasion while courts excuse the violation of your rights.\nIt implies that you are not a citizen of a democracy but the subject of a carceral state, just waiting to be cataloged.\u201d\n\n[Edwards v. Vannoy](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-5807_086c.pdf) (2021): The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 against retroactively applying its 2020 Ramos v. Louisiana ruling that a criminal defendant in state court as well as in federal court has a Sixth Amendment right to a unanimous jury verdict. The case involves Thedrick Edwards, an African American man, who was convicted of numerous serious crimes in Louisiana by a non-unanimous jury in Louisiana prior to Ramos. On each charge, Mr. Edwards was found guilty \u201cover the lone Black juror\u2019s vote to acquit.\u201d\n\n>Justice Kagan: For the first time in many decades, those convicted under rules found not to produce fair and reliable verdicts will be left without recourse in federal courts\u2026I would accept the consequences of last Term\u2019s holding in Ramos. A decision like that comes with a promise, or at any rate should. If the right to a unanimous jury is so fundamental\u2014if a verdict rendered by a divided jury is \u201cno verdict at all\u201d\u2014then Thedrick Edwards should not spend his life behind bars over two jurors\u2019 opposition.\n\n[Egbert v. Boule](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21-147_g31h.pdf) (2022): The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that immigration enforcement agents cannot be sued for violating an individual\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.\n\n[Vega v. Tekoh](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21-499_gfbh.pdf) (2022): The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that a person cannot sue a police officer under federal civil rights laws for violating their Fifth Amendment by failing to provide a Miranda warning. \u201cThe point of \u00a7 1983 is to provide such redress\u2014because a remedy \u2018is a vital component of any scheme for vindicating cherished constitutional guarantees,\u2019\u201d Justice Kagan wrote in dissent. \u201cThe majority here, as elsewhere, injures the right by denying the remedy.\u201d\n\n---\n---\n\n#DEATH PENALTY\n\n[Glossip v. Gross](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-7955_aplc.pdf) (2015): The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the use of unreliable drugs, which may cause pain and suffering, in lethal injection protocols does not violate the Eighth Amendment (prohibiting cruel and unusual punishments). Writing for the majority, Alito explained that the Eighth Amendment requires prisoners to show there is a known and available alternate method of execution. The alternative drugs the prisoners proposed were unavailable to Oklahoma due to drug manufacturers\u2019 refusal to manufacture and sell drugs meant to be used in executions; therefore, Alito reasoned, the court must side with the state.\n\n>Justice Breyer: \u201c\u2026under the Court's new rule, it would not matter whether the State intended to use midazolam, or instead to have petitioners drawn and quartered, slowly tortured to death, or actually burned at the stake: because petitioners failed to prove the availability of sodium thiopental or pentobarbital, the State could execute them using whatever means it designates.\"\n\n[Bucklew v. Precythe](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-8151_1qm2.pdf) (2019): The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that a prisoner who had a medical condition that would cause him to suffocate on his own blood from the lethal injection cocktail was not protected by the Eighth Amendment. Justice Gorsuch, writing for the majority, stated that the Eighth Amendment \"forbids 'cruel and unusual' methods of capital punishment but does not guarantee a prisoner a painless death.\u201d\n\nThere are many other instances of the Supreme Court allowing the execution of individuals who either (1) have strong innocence claims or (2) have strong mitigating factor claims, including [Hamm v.

Lewis](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-285_q8l1.pdf) (2018): The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that an employer can require its employees, as a condition of keeping their jobs, to submit to individual arbitration of wage-and-hour and other workplace-condition claims. The inability for employees to take collective action allows employers to be less accountable to employees, and deters employees from taking the time, cost, and effort needed to resolve individual arbitration, effectively silencing their concerns.\n\n[Janus v. AFSCME](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1466_2b3j.pdf) (2018): The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that public employees do not have to pay fees to unions to cover the costs of collective bargaining, overturning 41 years of precedent and weakening unions.\n\n[Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/19-7_n6io.pdf) (2020): The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the president (Trump, at the time) may fire the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent agency responsible for consumer protection, without cause.",

        "Title": "Top 3 Best Artifact Domains Based on the Overall Meta and Experience in Playing the Game over a Year.",
        "Body/Content": "After playing the game for over a year, I would like to share my thoughts on the best artifact domains based partly on resin efficiency and partly on their value due to the units that use them. Therefore without further ado, these are in my opinion the best artifact domains based on the value that they provide.\u00a0\n\n1) Emblem of Severed Fate / Shimenawa\u2019s Reminiscence\u00a0\n\nMihoyo might have unintentionally made an artifact domain that saved a lot of the grief of switching from place to place when trying to upgrade a unit\u2019s stats. Veterans might already know why this domain is the GOAT, but for new players, this domain is basically the most resin efficient domain in the game as the emblem set provides a damage boost to your burst based on the amount of energy recharge that you have from sub-stats, weapon stats, and etc. While initially it was made for the Raiden Shogun specifically, it had the side effect of actually being effective on other units as well. Units that depend on their burst and are energy hungry like Xiang Ling and Xing Qiu really benefit from the set as they are in need of high ER as well as the fact that it also boosts their damage. The 4 piece Shimenawas however, isn't really the best for anyone with the exception of probably Melt Ganyu as you don't depend much on your burst while melting or Hu Tao if you\u2019re willing to not use your burst less often and the fact that it's much easier to farm than CW or WT, even Yoimiya wants other sets like a 2 CW and 2 Shimenawas because her burst is an important part of her damage. However, because 2 piece attack and 20% free ER are solid set bonuses, characters that don't really depend on\u00a0 bonuses like Xiao, Fischl, and Childe can be farmed here too even if it might not be the overall best for them as the sub stats should outweigh it. Because of the universality of these sets and how most of the top meta units benefit from it, it can safely be said that this domain is the best overall as players can be more resin efficient by being able to slot multiple emblems and shimes to their units, making unit upgrading slightly easier and faster.\u00a0\n\n\n2) Blizzard Strayer and Heart of Depth\u00a0\n\n\nMost domains are tailored to specific units so not everyone can use it, however this domain in particular is a special case because of the units that use them: Ganyu, Ayaka, Childe, and to an extent Xing Qiu. The 4 units I mentioned above are one of the most top meta units in the game because of Freeze and National. The Blizzard set saves a lot of grief from CR and CD balancing due because it gives free 20% CR when enemies are affected by Cryo and another 20% when they are frozen. While this means that CR balancing is not as much of an issue this could potentially turn CR into somewhat of a dead stat as you might overcap on it. This also makes EM useless since freeze doesn't benefit from EM at all. Therefore the only desirable stats are attack%, energy recharge, and critical damage. Despite not being mentioned earlier, other Cryo units like Kaeya and Rosaria also somewhat benefit from the set by virtue of being Cryo, if you're focusing on building Ganyu or Ayaka and also building the other two, the set is welcomed by them.\u00a0\n\n\nChilde is so far the only winner for this set since Xing Qiu benefits more from Emblem than Heart of Depth, Mona prefers 4 Noblesse or Tenacity, and Kokomi prefers Tenacity or Clam set. However because Ganyu and Ayaka are meta and the fact that free CR is good you would still farm for the domain anyways. Also, even if the 4 set is useless on Xing Qiu the 2 piece Heart of Depth still benefits him as long as the sub-stats are good.\u00a0\n\n\n\n3) Viridescent Venerer\u00a0\n\nThe Viridescent Venerer domain might be valued more if it weren't for the fact that it's paired with one of the most useless artifact sets in the game: 4 piece maidens. However, the set is still top 3 because the value of its units in no particular order: Venti, Kazuha, and Sucrose, are so high that you would want to farm that domain after you're done with your carries. The reason is because the 4 piece Viridescent set gives a 15% anemo damage bonus and swirl damage bonus to your unit as well as providing supportive utilities by giving further damage increase to your carries through the 40% shred. 40% shred is no joke as the buff is simple to trigger and this is just from the set itself, not including the other utilities that each anemo unit provide from their kit. There is a reason why anemo units are used a lot in reaction based comps, since they provide grouping, suction, damage, and buffs. The set basically elevates anemo to be one the best elements in the game competing with hydro.\u00a0\n\n\nThe reason why this domain is at the bottom of the top 3 despite the set and units is again due to the existence of Maidens, one of the worst sets to ever exist in the game as the Ocean Hued Clam set now exists, which allows healers to provide additional damage as well as healing. If only they were paired with something like Noblesse then the ranking of this domain might go higher.\u00a0\n\n\nNote, the reason why the NO domain isn\u2019t mentioned is due to the fact that the strongbox now exists. Bennett and Mona at low investments just need ER for their burst uptime. You do not pay mind to their damage at all.\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough this might be obvious stuff to know for most people, I think it\u2019s best to point out some obvious but overlooked stuff because some people might forget about it. This I hope is also good for new players who are planning to attain the new units in the future as this might be good for them to know in order to prioritize and pick domains based on the aforementioned units.\u00a0\n\n\nTherefore, here are all my thoughts and opinions laid out.\u00a0",

        "Title": "I watch a horror movie every day, here are the best ones I watched in 2020",
        "Body/Content": "(2020) ***Invisible Man*** 9/10\n\nThis remake, simply put, is excellent. I\u2019m a huge fan of Leigh Whannell and while I do think the story itself is fantastic, it\u2019s his directing that blew me away. This movie is so fucking tense without showing anything for a huge majority of its runtime. When shit actually starts to go down, it\u2019s the definition of thrilling. Elisabeth Moss killed her role.\n\n(2020) ***The Rental*** 8/10\n\nThe meat and bones of this movie is a character driven drama story. It\u2019s tense and having so much knowledge right away as the viewer that the characters don\u2019t have is frankly anxiety inducing, in a good way. I thought all four main performances were fantastic, especially Sheila Vand. There\u2019s a moment in the film where everything is abruptly subverted in a grand horror fashion and depending on your tastes, that may be off-putting. To me, it was absolutely genius. Dave Franco directed the fuck out of this movie and eliminated all the comfort of campiness that great slashers usually hold.\n\n(2020) ***Relic*** 8/10\n\nRobyn Nevin is fantastic here and all the supporting roles are great but not only does this woman make the movie, she is the movie. Her dialogue, her delivery and her body language, at least to me, are a huge chunk of the entire plot. I just found this movie to be gentle until it isn\u2019t, which makes for the most tense moments. It\u2019s a very claustrophobic film; I think it does justice to a very serious and frightening illness.\n\n(2020) ***Palm Springs*** 8/10\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take long to catch on that, while this is a romantic comedy, it\u2019s also a sci-fi horror film and a specific subset of sci-fi that makes me anxious. So in some regards, at least to genre placement, there\u2019s my bias. The movie is seriously a treat though. It\u2019s a new spin on an old formula and it\u2019s genuinely funny, suspenseful and endearing. Even if you disagree that it shouldn\u2019t be discussed in the horror circles, you won\u2019t regret watching it.\n\n(2020) ***Shirley*** 7/10\n\nIt\u2019s an incredibly interesting film for many reasons but mostly because it exists as a biopic, as well as a psychological horror film. Jackson is played Elisabeth Moss who is just wonderful. She really brought to life the internal struggle of Jackson. I\u2019d suggest doing some research before diving into this because her profession during the time period was not glamorous or widely accepted, which gives context to, well, everything.\n\n(2020) ***Becky*** 8/10\n\nKevin James was fantastic. He\u2019s a sadistic fuck in this movie. But he doesn\u2019t deserve all the credit and the writers don\u2019t either. I\u2019m going to highlight Greta Zozula here. The most powerful moments in this entire film were purely cinematography based. Melanie Garros and Jenn McGouran deserve a shoutout as well. This was a cookie-cutter home invasion film at its core and these people, among others, made it one of my favorite home invasion films of the decade. Alissa Gee deserves recognition too for creating the most disgusting moment I\u2019ve seen in a minute.\n\n(2019) ***Parasite*** 9/10\n\nThis film is most obviously on-the-nose but in the same breath, so incredibly impactful. I can\u2019t even describe the seamless transition from black comedy to horror. It\u2019s a heartbreaking view on classism and poverty while also just being a thrilling experience. Every single performance is remarkable and natural. I\u2019m not even sure what else to say without spoiling it. This film isn\u2019t just specific to Asian culture but very relevant to anyone feeling that they\u2019re in a rut.\n\n(2019) ***Villains*** 8/10\n\nThe premise is sort of simple but the horror is in the details. i loved how everything played out and I thought all four main actors did an incredible job. Everything was super convincing which had me invested and tense. There\u2019s a scene at the end, despite the movies dark, comedic aspects, that was really sweet and very climactic.\n\n(2019) ***Swallow*** 9/10\n\nHaley Bennett delivers a heartbreaking performance with a powerful but melancholy ending. The narrative itself is twisted and sadistic. This film make me anxious, depressed and in the end, I\u2019m not sure it offered much reprieve. I loved this film but I\u2019d caution anyone going through mental trauma to venture cautiously into it. It doesn\u2019t promote anything negative but the subject matter can be difficult.\n\n(2019) ***Nimic*** 8/10\n\nWhen I googled the name of this film it gave me the Romanian translation of \u201cnothing\u201d but also, \u201ceverything\u201d. For a 10-minute short it offers so much. It felt like a powerfully dark statement about performance in general.\n\n(2019) ***The Head Hunter*** 9/10\n\nThis was one of the most creative, restrained yet somehow absolutely insane movies I\u2019ve seen all year. I\u2019m absolutely blown away. The exposition is limited and told so refreshingly through almost entirely visuals. It\u2019s caused many viewers frustrations but for me, it was absolutely the best aspect. That\u2019s saying a lot because visually, stylistically, it\u2019s fucking remarkable. I\u2019ve heard people say this movie is boring and to me, there\u2019s not a dull moment throughout the entire film, not a single wasted shot. It\u2019s thrilling, dark, gritty, campy at times and embodies this identity that\u2019s both somehow fluid and refined. It feels like an arthouse film in its minimalism but avoids any pretentiousness you may associate with that sub-genre. Jordan Downey has done some intentionally so-bad-it\u2019s good movies in the past and he clearly wanted to still reference those aspects through some of his shlocky, 50\u2019s horror inspirations in here; especially Fiend Without a Face. That\u2019s a creative decision that will turn a lot of people off but I just really appreciated it and it made the actual watching experience so incredibly fun.\n\n(2019) ***The Lighthouse*** 9.5/10\n\nThis film is among the few that I felt compelled to watch it again almost immediately. It\u2019s so incredibly rich in every aspect that can make a movie successful. The visuals are jaw-dropping; almost every single frame of this film is photographic. The soundtrack is stripped down to just these haunting sounds of fog horns and piss buckets. The package everything is delivered in, from an artistic standpoint, is so memorable. The performances by Pattinson and Dafoe are both some of the best I\u2019ve seen this entire year and really, the decade\u2026possibly of all time. They deliver this brilliant script\u2019s dialogue with such passion, humor and intensity. The story in this film is shrouded in mystery but the clues and tools needed to decipher it do exist and with a rewatch, finding them felt so rewarding. It\u2019s the kind of movie that I want to make my friends watch, simply so I have someone to discuss it with. It\u2019s one of the best horror films I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\n(2019) ***I Trapped the Devil*** 7/10\n\nThis one is a bit of a slow-burn but I felt the tension from beginning to end so none of it felt like a blind investment. It had the potential to be another, cookie-cutter, pretentious statement but what I found it to be was simply a well-crafted horror film.\n\n(2019) ***Pet Sematary*** 7.5/10\n\nThe original film was entertaining to me but I felt it was also dated and a bit too unintentionally silly for my tastes. So going into this, I was hoping for a darker, more serious film and I\u2019m happy to say, that\u2019s what I got.\n\n(2019) ***Guns Akimbo*** 7.5/10\n\nThis is non-stop gory action, an absurd story and an insane performance by Radcliffe, who I\u2019m such a big fan of at this point. The best part? It\u2019s genuinely, laugh-out-loud funny, both through physical comedy and clever dialogue.\n\n(2019) ***Harpoon*** 7/10\n\nI enjoyed this movie a lot and I mean \u201cenjoyed\u201d in every sense of the word. It was the kind of movie to stop making me think so critically about the acting and cinematography because I just find the stranded genre so fun. This movie really delivered in both dark humor and pure, unpredictability.\n\n(2019) ***Annabelle Comes Home*** 7/10\n\nI know that Gary Dauberman has worked closely with the series so he definitely understands Wan\u2019s Conjuring universe\u2019s vibe. I mean that from both a pacing and cinematography standpoint. I loved that all the possessed artifacts come into play.\n\n(2019) ***Vivarium*** 8/10\n\nThis movie is fucking terrifying. The cast may even be too loaded because it\u2019s the environment and Senan Jennings that makes everything so scary. The final 30 minutes of this film are a complete mindfuck and just left my jaw on the floor.\n\n(2019) ***It Chapter 2*** 9/10\n\nIt embodies the heartfelt, character driven story of King\u2019s novel so incredibly well. Every single performance by the adult actors is fantastic and as much as people didn\u2019t like the overuse of humor, it felt like a natural evolution to me. Things were destined to be less scary with the adult characters coming into contact with an evil they\u2019ve faced before. The last 30-min to me were just so touching, sad and it was the culmination I was hoping for.\n\n(2019) ***Zombieland: Double Tap*** 7.5/10\n\nIt\u2019s certainly a sequel as far as sequels go but I had a ton of fun with it and it was great to see this group back together. It\u2019s a super cheesy film and I would expect some hate but the original is cheesy fun too, if even to a lesser extent.\n\n(2019) ***The Color Out of Space*** 7/10\n\nThe entire suspense if the film is how each individual character reacts to this unknown force but Cage\u2019s is of course the most volatile. I love the body horror and I think the entire movie is pretty goddamn exciting in that aspect. It goes so far beyond what you\u2019d expect.\n\n(2019) ***Joker*** 9.5/10\n\nTo have a Batman-universe film stand out this much among all the others is incredible. This film intentionally evokes almost every emotion until a raw, chilling finale. Gotham is unkempt, unstable and teetering. \n\n(2019) ***Come to Daddy*** 7.5/10\n\nThis movie is definitely a dark comedy but it\u2019s incredibly interesting in that, among the dark humor, is a real horror movie and a very graphic one at that.\n\n(2019) ***The Lodge*** 9/10\n\nThe misdirects in this story are excellent and I was blown away about how well the cinematography was used to manipulate the viewer. It feels like it\u2019s twist after twist but in reality, nothing changes and that\u2019s the scariest aspect to the entire movie.\n\n(2019) ***Home with a View of the Monster*** 7/10\n\nThey do a fantastic job of storytelling, switching timelines and perspectives throughout the film. It\u2019s a technique that\u2019s been around longer than we\u2019ve all been alive but one that\u2019s not easily mastered.\n\n(2019) ***Ready or Not*** 7.5/10\n\nIt\u2019s just a ton of fun and Samara Weaving is fantastic. There\u2019s so much great meta-humor and the effects are top notch. I think this sub-genre of sadistic games being played has been done to death so it was a welcomed surprise to see a film do it in such a successful way.\n\n(2019) ***The Platform*** 9.5/10\n\nOne of my favorite things about horror is that you can trace history itself through the decades, with films reflecting the current political, social and economic state around the globe. First we has Us and then another incredible film Parasite, all with similar desperate themes of class instability. Then you have The Platform, which in its pure brutalism combines horror, religion and politics to make an incredibly powerful statement.\n\n(2019) ***I See You*** 9/10\n\nThis film consistently surprised, disappointed and impressed me throughout its runtime based purely on my own expectations. It frankly made a fool out of me.\n\n(2019) ***The Vast of Night*** 7/10\n\nThis movie is pretty low-budget but they really worked with what they had to create this warm, throwback aesthetic that just tickled my tiny little nuts. It\u2019s a dialogue driven, on-the-nose *Twilight Zone* homage and I really enjoyed it.\n\n(2019) ***John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum*** 8/10\n\n The choreography and production is mesmerizing. This might be a Hollywood mainstream action film but the kills are powerful and fucking brutal.\n\n(2018) ***Bloodline*** 7.5/10\n\nSean William Scott is a forever type casted actor but has managed to break free of that throughout the years and this is another great example of him doing just that. His performance is reserved but effective.\n\n(2018) ***Gwen*** 8.5/10\n\nIt\u2019s an incredibly heartbreaking story that, while exists in the folk-horror genre, subverts any and all expectations. Eleanor Worthington-Cox and Maxine Peaks carry the entire film.\n\n(2018) ***Freaks*** 8/10\n\nEmile Hirsch, Amanda Crew and Lexy Kolker were all great but it was Bruce Dern who blew me away. He\u2019s such a powerful on-screen presence; just his delivery alone establishes a lot of the more horrifying elements to this film. \n\n(2018) ***Overlord*** 8/10\n\nI thought it would be a traditional zombie movie and the circumstances would be the twist but it was its own thing. It\u2019s kind of difficult to describe but I think action-war-horror would be the closest thing I could pin it too. Jovan Adepo was a great fucking lead. \n\n(2018) ***Monster Party*** 7.5/10\n\nIt\u2019s awesome to experiment but this is a film that will appeal to almost everyone without feeling unoriginal or sold out. This is dark humor at its most enjoyable and the practical effects and gore are fucking awesome.\n\n(2018) ***Pledge*** 7.5/10\n\nIt\u2019s a simple premise but so well executed. I loved the ending and pretty much 95% of the creative decisions. This isn\u2019t a bloodbath of a horror film but it\u2019s violent as hell.\n\n(2018) ***High Life*** 7/10\n\nThis film is a really uncomfortable watch from beginning to end. It\u2019s filled with violent, psychosexual imagery, a disjointed narrative and cum. It ends and if you don\u2019t outright hate it, it\u2019s hard to explain why you like it because it\u2019s such a rough watch. I fall in the latter category.\n\n(2018) ***Possum*** 8/10\n\nI love the way the story unfolds in the end, just methodically bit-by-bit until a crushing reveal. I felt for this main character and his pain seemed so real.\n\n(2018) ***Wildling*** 8/10\n\nBel Powley and Liv Tyler both play very complimentary fantastic roles. There\u2019s an extended portion of the film that\u2019s almost uplifting and pleasantly strange, following their relationship with each other. I\u2019m happy to say things turn sinister quickly and the last 30-minutes are a wild ride, to say the least.\n\n (2018) ***The Nightingale*** 9.5/10\n\nJennifer Kent decided to put in such a universally disgusting scene that had people walking out of screenings and almost justifiably so. It\u2019s really difficult to watch in portions. It\u2019s just fortunate she followed it up with a masterpiece. \n\n(2017) ***John Wick: Chapter 2*** 8/10\n\nThese assassins dance so carefully around innocent civilians that it almost comes off as a black comedy, in a great way.\n\n(2017) ***My Friend Dahmer*** 8/10\n\nTo me, especially with Ross Lynch\u2019s performance, it was an equally endearing and chilling film. It humanized someone who I\u2019ve always considered to be a literal monster, which is something I don\u2019t know how to feel about.\n\n(2017) ***One Cut of the Dead*** 7/10\n\nThis movie is super creative and pretty fucking hilarious. It feels like a modern day *Bowfinger*.\n\n(2017) ***Marrowbone*** 7.5/10\n\nThe characters portrayed are vibrant and fully realized, whether it be through substance or lack-there-of. I obviously don\u2019t actively try and predict movies like a gameshow but this film seemed to excel in misdirect.\n\n(2016) ***White Girl*** 8/10\n\nIt reminded me a lot of Larry Clark\u2019s Kids but actually intelligently modernized to make a statement on these neighborhoods on the fringe of gentrification.\n\n(2016) ***The Lighthouse*** 7.5/10\n\nMark Lewis Jones and Michael Jibson play their respective roles as the lighthouse keepers really well. Towards the end of the film when the story demands even more of them both, they truly deliver.\n\n(2015) ***Room*** 9/10\n\nBrie Larson is an incredible actress and plays this profoundly realistic character. There's moments where emotions do bubble over but most of the time, she does so much by doing so little. \n\n(2015) ***Jurassic World*** 7.5/10\n\nSome people will be completely turned off by some of the more absurd and out-there plot elements but I have to say, despite it being cheesy on paper, a lot of the newer sci-fi concepts just happen to work. This is bound to forever be kind of divisive but I liked it.\n\n(2015) ***Tag*** 8.5/10\n\nIt\u2019s like *Tokyo Gore Police* meets *The Matrix*. Sono makes a powerful statement on film media, gender oppression and interestingly enough, he doesn\u2019t leave himself out of the lens of criticism.\n\n(2015) ***The Invitation*** 9/10\n\nThis movie\u2019s horror aspect is incredibly telegraphed and manipulated with these creepy violin sounds. However, Karyn Kusama\u2019s impeccably clean cinematography and direction use all of that to its benefit.\n\n(2014) ***John Wick*** 8/10\n\nI saw this movie in theaters and let me just say, as a beagle owner, this may be my favorite revenge movie. Keanu Reeves is badass as shit and it was the first film in a long time to make me interested in action. \n\n(2014) ***Spring*** 8.5/10\n\nIt feels helpless and hopeful at the same time, Benson\u2019s script is amazing. I\u2019ve always said that films shot in idyllic landscapes are a blank canvas for horror. There\u2019s so much beautiful contrast.\n\n(2014) ***The Treatment*** 7.5/10\n\nThis film is so unnerving, dark and depressing. The bones of it are structured like any crime thriller but the meat of it is pure depravity. \n\n(2014) ***Clown*** 8/10\n\nThis is body horror and one of the better ones out there; the slow, methodical transformation throughout this movie was so effective.\n\n(2014) ***The Incident*** 9/10\n\nBleak doesn\u2019t even begin to describe this film. It\u2019s pure nihilism, screamed loudly into the universe.\n\n(2014) ***The Guest*** 8.5/10\n\n I fucking love the story, Dan Stevens is fantastic and the production was cleanly executed. It\u2019s Adam Wingard\u2019s best film so far.\n\n (2013) ***Blue Ruin*** 9/10\n\nIt\u2019s a standout to me among revenge films. Macon Blair\u2019s character isn\u2019t some bloodthirsty ex-navy seal bent on revenge. He\u2019s a completely broken man that\u2019s overcome by heartbreak.\n\n(2013) ***Evil Dead*** 7.5/10\n\nIt\u2019s one of the few examples where a remake of a classic, near perfect movie, actually works.\n\n(2013) ***Redemption*** 8/10\n\nThe film is shot so well, the editing and portrayal of the visuals all correspond to the ebb and flow of his characters physical and mental health.\n\n(2013) ***Under the Skin*** 9/10\n\nThe second death in this movie is one of the most remarkably unsettling scenes I\u2019ve witnessed to date. \n\n(2011) ***The Strange Thing About the Johnsons*** 7/10\n\nAstor flips child molestation on its head in a tense, sickeningly well-made film and I absolute hate it. Do not watch this movie, this will only detract from your overall happiness.\n\n(2011) ***Contagion*** 9/10\n\nThere\u2019s some fantastic performances by Paltrow, Law, Fishburne and quite a few others. However, it\u2019s the research and writing of this film, the frightening scientific accuracy, that makes it so effective. \n\n(2011) ***We Need to Talk About Kevin*** 9/10\n\nThis is probably one of the most sensitive subjects you can approach and I\u2019m a huge fan of Lynne Ramsay. Ezra Miller has one of the most chillingly realistic performances of the decade.\n\n(2010) ***Inception*** 9.5/10\n\nIt\u2019s Nolan\u2019s masterpiece in my mind and that statement isn\u2019t to be taken lightly, as everything he\u2019s done has felt powerful. \n\n(2010) ***Buried*** 8/10\n\nThis is one of my favorite movies filmed all in one location. It\u2019s tense, claustrophobic (obviously) and it feels genuinely helpless.\n\n(2010) ***Skeletons*** 7/10\n\nIt\u2019s a strange little film but it\u2019s charming, smart and a refreshing take on the exorcism sub-genre.\n\n(2009) ***The House of the Devil*** 8/10\n\n My absolute favorite aspect of this film is the retro feel. It captured 70\u2019s horror so incredibly well. Ti West is a talented filmmaker and this is one of my favorites by him.\n\n(2009) ***Cropsey*** 7/10\n\nIf there was one thing I really took away from this film, it would be how society and children in particular adapt to unsolved murders.\n\n(2009) ***The Loved Ones*** 7.5/10\n\nIt reminds of almost a modern day interpretation on *The Texas Chainsaw Massacre*, if the dinner scene was the entire film. \n\n(2008) ***Lake Mungo*** 9/10\n\nThis family is so incredibly natural, real and convincing. It\u2019s not too over the top. The horror is hidden in every frame and simultaneously interwoven with heartbreak. Despite many previous and later films attempting to do what it does, I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. \n\n(2007) ***An American Crime*** 7.5/10\n\nElliot Page is wonderful as Sylvia Likens, she just has this innocent nature to her that amplified the violent aspects of the film. I loved the editing of courtroom footage throughout the runtime, it was a constant reminder that what you\u2019re watching actually happened, despite the theatrical nature of the film at times.\n\n(2007) ***Teeth*** 8/10\n\nTeeth is actually such an incredibly hard movie to review critically. The film itself, as a whole, is so many things at once. It\u2019s a comedy, an exploitation film, a revenge film and even sort of\u2026a slasher? I have to give respect where respect is due. \n\n(2007) ***Death Sentence*** 7/10\n\nThis movie is so goddamn intense during the action sequences that it actual reminds me more of a Max Payne video game film adaptation. It\u2019s so over-the-top but in a really entertaining way.\n\n(2007) ***Timecrimes*** 8.5/10\n\n I loved this movie when I first saw it but upon re-watching it, I can\u2019t help but stress its influence in the time-loop horror sub-genre. Sure films like Primer definitely helped pave the way but Timecrimes really manages to focus less on the science fiction and more on the horrifying consequences that come with time travel. \n\n(2007) ***Zodiac*** 9/10\n\nIt\u2019s not the most violent film, it\u2019s much more story driven but the moments of violence feel fucking powerful. The horror in this film isn\u2019t about the serial killer, it\u2019s really about obsession and Gyllenhaal absolutely nails his performance to bring that aspect home.\n\n(2006) ***Population 436*** 7/10\n\nIt didn\u2019t aim to disgust or push boundaries; it\u2019s just a fun, creepy story with a satisfying ending.\n\n(2006) ***Children of Men*** 9.5/10\n\nIt\u2019s a bleak film, as bleak as they come from some perspectives but through the violence and despair is a powerful message of hope. Clive Owen\u2019s character is as a broken as the world around him and one of my favorite character arcs of all time.\n\n(2005) ***Red Eye*** 7/10\n\nThe setup is sinister enough, being in the confines of a plane, to warrant it being discussed as a horror but it does devolve into an action thriller, not that I\u2019m a genre-snob. Both Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are fantastic and it\u2019s a tight knit package. \n\n(2005) ***The Descent*** 9.5/10\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely terrifying and top-to-bottom, one of the most effective horror movies ever made. After seeing over a thousand horror projects, this still remains one of the most intense, period.\n\n(2005) ***Constantine*** 8.5/10\n\nListen, I\u2019ve obviously never even heard about this comic but let me just say, as a standalone movie, it\u2019s fucking awesome. It\u2019s basically Keanu Reeves battling his way through hell, murking demons and basically just being badass as shit. \n\n(2004) ***Saw*** 8/10\n\nIt\u2019s one of the most creative projects of the 00\u2019s and a project that launched Wan\u2019s and Whannell\u2019s career. I can safely say, the two of them haven\u2019t had any major misses since. This movie is raw, disturbing and has a strong mystery-driven backbone that makes it iconic and endlessly re-watchable. I absolutely love it.\n\n(2004) ***Hellboy*** 7.5/10\n\nListen, I\u2019m not a fucking nerd who is all-knowing about these comics and how well they translate to film but let me tell you, this movie fucking rocks. Ron Perlman kills this role and has so much personality.\n\n(2000) ***The Gift*** 8.5/10\n\n Everyone here is wonderful. If I had to pick a standout though, it would be Giovanni Ribisi. His performance is so raw and emotive. The unstable nature of his character actually held up as the backbone to the mystery portion of this film, making it very much unpredictable.\n\n(1999) ***The Ninth Gate*** 9/10\n\nIt\u2019s two hours of a giant satanic onion being peeled back layer by layer. It\u2019s clear that when Polanski isn\u2019t raping children, he\u2019s creating filmmaking masterpieces. \n\n(1999) ***Deep Blue Sea*** 7.5/10\n\nThe science-fiction aspects may be super contrived to someone smarter than I am but the entire movie is so goddamn entertaining. I love all the characters and LL Cool J is particularly hilarious.\n\n(1998) ***Pi*** 7.5/10\n\nAronofsky is challenging religion with science and mathematics and it comes together in a really insane way.\n\n(1997) ***The Lost World: Jurassic Park*** 7/10\n\nOne scene in particular that stuck with me was the raptors in the tall grass, so aesthetically gorgeous and well-shot. It\u2019s not a perfect movie but Goldblum and Moore are charismatic, it\u2019s fucking action packed and the set pieces are diverse as shit. This isn\u2019t some dialed in bullshit for a quick buck.\n\n(1997) ***Men in Black*** 9/10\n\nVincent D\u2019Onofrio was fucking incredible. The entire villain that is Edgar is one of my favorites of all time. Everything from his speech, his loose-skin and awkwardly stiff gate just really sell it.\n\n(1996) ***The Craft*** 7.5/10\n\nI love all the acting and characters but Fairuza Balk is probably my favorite. She\u2019s just so eclectic and over-the-top.\n\n(1995) ***Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight*** 7/10\n\nThis is such a fun movie and very much in the Tales from the Crypt vein. It\u2019s campy but super violent too; the practical effects are fucking dope. It\u2019s kind of like Evil Dead meets From Dusk till Dawn. Billy Zane is great in it and just brings a ton of personally to the film. I even really dug the raunchy, meta-horror opening.\n\n(1994) ***The Mask*** 7/10\n\n Jim Carrey is his usual, hilarious, eclectic, over-the-goddamn-top self which softens the edges. There\u2019s also a villain though and the same childish aspects don\u2019t apply to him. As a kid, he was kind of scary actually.\n\n(1993) ***Jurassic Park*** 9.5/10\n\nEven just typing that title blows my mind, this movie was made in 1993 and 27 years later, it still looks better than most modern monster movies. Jurassic Park is everything. This movie is the perfect blend of horror, action, adventure and sci-fi. \n\n(1991) ***Highway to Hell*** 7.5/10\n\nThis is an absolutely awesome 90\u2019s horror movie. It has cameos from the entire Stiller family, even fucking Gilbert Gottfried. You also have Chad Lowe, who I truthfully didn\u2019t even know existed. The story, set pieces and script are also all excellent. It\u2019s darkly funny, well-paced and just a wild ride from start to finish.\n\n(1990) ***The Exorcist 3*** 8.5/10\n\nThis movie, for a film following such an iconic movie, being a third film in a series, is just bafflingly good. The original writer of the first film is returning and his script as well as directorial product both deliver. \n\n(1989) ***Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade*** 8/10\n\nIndy is still Indy here, he\u2019s fucking badass; his character and dialogue excel in this entry immensely. Not just dialogue but this film contains some of the best action choreography of the entire series, something that almost seems unfairly diminished through repetition. This movie is fucking awesome.\n\n(1988) ***Akira*** 7.5/10\n\nThis story is one that would feel very difficult to pull off through traditional media. The level of violence and body horror would possibly be even too much for Cronenberg\u2019s plate. The ending of this film is mind-melting.\n\n(1988) ***Hellbound: Hellraiser 2*** 7.5/10\n\nIt\u2019s violent, dark, disgusting and gory as fuck. It feels like a fever dream of hell. I loved the female character kind of forcing this disgusting erotic nature and it doubled down on the series soul which is the deadly allure of hell. \n\n(1988) ***Vampire\u2019s Kiss*** 7/10\n\nI love American Psycho and watching this, I can see where a ton of the performance inspiration in that film came from. Cage\u2019s body language here is so insanely expressive and probably my favorite part of the entire project. Even if you\u2019ve seen this one before, I highly suggest a re-watch, there\u2019s something special about it.\n\n(1987) ***Fatal Attraction*** 7.5/10\n\nHoly shit Glenn Close you goddamn crazy bitch, such a great performance. This movie is so incredibly and exponentially tense as it plays out. I loved Micheal Douglas and the entire film is just a reminder to never fucking cheat.\n\n(1987) ***The Believers*** 7/10\n\nIt gets a bit absurd at certain points but the cult aspects are awesome. I also think it\u2019s the first horror movie I\u2019ve seen specifically about Santeria. It\u2019s not perfect but it stuck with me.\n\n(1987) ***The Lost Boys*** 8/10\n\n Joel Schumacher\u2019s The Lost Boys is so indicative of 80\u2019s horror that it could very well be the face of the decade itself. The one-liners, the practical effects, aesthetics and story are all just wonderful. I\u2019m not sure what else to say, this movie feels like a warm blanket to me. \n\n(1986) ***Little Shop of Horrors*** 8/10\n\nRick Moranis is as goofy as ever and good god\u2026the practical effects are mind-blowing. You\u2019re watching this giant plant movie and it just melts your brain thinking about how it was accomplished. \n\n(1986) ***Aliens*** 7/10\n\nThey exploited the action of the first film to capture a larger audience and lost what made Alien such an effective horror movie in the first place. I still like this movie because it contains my favorite heroin and monster but I\u2019m sick of acting like the Alien series ever needed a director like Cameron. The ending is absolutely insane and bumps this up a few points for sure. \n\n(1984) ***The Terminator*** 8/10\n\nThis movie, simply put, is badass as shit. I\u2019m aware the series kind of progresses into more action focused territory with the sequels but the original will always be a horror movie to me. The pacing, the unstoppable force that is Arnold, it\u2019s all thrilling as shit. \n\n(1984) ***Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom*** 8/10\n\nI think it\u2019s a scary movie and a really dark turn in the trilogy. There are quirky aspects of it character wise that are kind of goofy but playful. Overall though, goddamn dude, these set pieces are amazing. \n\n(1984) ***Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter*** 7/10\n\nJason is super fucking powerful here; he moves quickly, intelligently and is able to drive the suspense of the movie. The success is greatly attributed to a solid performance by Crispin Glover but more importantly, Corey Feldman. I know Corey gets a lot of shit these days but he was an eclectic child actor.\n\n(1981) ***Raiders of the Lost Ark*** 9/10\n\nRaiders of the Lost Arc is such an important movie to me. It helped open my eyes to darker content as a child, for better or worse. Everything that could ever be said about this film has been said, I\u2019m just here to show my appreciation.\n\n (1980) ***City of the Living Dead*** 8/10\n\nThis movie is batshit insane in the best way possible. It\u2019s ultra-gory, tons of crazy impressive practical effects which are very much Fulci in style. The narrative is a bit confusing but I think, or hope at least, intentionally so. \n\n(1980) ***The Ninth Configuration*** 7/10\n\nThe Ninth Configuration, while still representing William Peter Blatty\u2019s struggle with religion, is tonally very different from *The Exorcist*. It\u2019s a tedious, slow, detail oriented, character driven film that exceeds so well because of great writing.\n\n(1979) ***Nosferatu the Vampire*** 8/10\n\nThis film not only embodies and celebrates the original in terms of structure as well as substance, but in its restrained filmmaking methods; its ability to let shots live without intervention. It\u2019s atmospheric, well-trimmed and just an all-around, exceptional film. Klaus Kinsi as Nosferatu is perfect.\n\n(1979) ***The Amityville Horror*** 7/10\n\nI like James Brolin\u2019s character, he\u2019s odd and the axe sharpening is somewhat iconic. The film has both pacing issues as well as dialogue issues. With that being said though, the finale in sinister as fuck and really brings life, quite literally, to this evil house. \n\n(1979) ***Alien*** 9.5/10\n\nMy love for this single film transcends my love for the genre itself. Ridley Scott pulled off an absolute masterpiece and despite having watched it 25 times, I still cannot comprehend how a film of this quality was pulled off in 1979. It\u2019s as close as perfection can be.\n\n(1978) ***Dawn of the Dead*** 8/10\n\nObviously at first glance you can tell this is a really lengthy film at over 2-hours long. However, the pacing is actually my favorite part. Romero really builds up to the climax slowly and lets you linger in his world for such a long time that it becomes fleshed out through pure exposure. \n\n(1978) ***Slave to the Cannibal God*** 7/10\n\nI love the visuals, the story and Ursula Andress\u2019 great big dirty milkers. It\u2019s a wonderful, sleazy little exploitation film. The audio is also fantastic; I just love the way this film is edited all around.\n\n(1977) ***Shock Waves*** 7/10\n\nPeter Cushing is awesome and I really liked Brooke Adams as well. Despite the cheesy premise though, this film is dark and moody. The tension and action really builds throughout the film and with the atmospheric nature, you kind of forget the ridiculousness of it all.\n\n(1975) ***Satanico Pandemonium*** 7/10\n\nThis is a pretty great, atmospheric, old-school exploitation film. It dives right into the temptations of sex and the devil among this convent. It gets pretty fucking dark, especially for the time period, specifically for Mexican horror.\n\n(1974) ***Vampyres*** 9/10\n\nIt\u2019s dark, moody, sexy and offers one of the most unique vampire film experiences to date. It\u2019s a film that makes Dennis\u2019 idea from It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia about a full-penetration, Dolph Lundgren crime fighting movie seem almost plausible. \n\n(1973) ***Soylent Green*** 8/10\n\nI loved all the concepts and details in this film. It took me a bit to get invested but once I was, real food was replaced with gold in my brain watching the plot play out. Charlton Heston did a great job of bringing life to this fictional universe as well through his dynamic and invested performance.\n\n(1973) ***The Crazies*** 7/10\n\nThere\u2019s this great scene with this old lady knitting that I just adore. The innocent and violent clash in such an effective way. Obviously the horror aspects in that scene, as well as the virus itself are very fictional. The government response though, seems almost plausible, considering how they\u2019re currently handling Covid-19.\n\n (1972) ***Horror Express*** 8/10\n\n It\u2019s genuinely creepy to this day and the storyline is ambitious as fuck. I\u2019d be hard-pressed to say it\u2019s not one of the better horror-sci-fis of the 70\u2019s and that category includes some great fucking films.\n\n(1968) ***Even the Wind is Afraid*** 8/10\n\n Coming over a decade before *Suspiria*, I can\u2019t but feel, despite how unknown this film is, how influential it was to the genre. The story is great; it\u2019s not super violent or anything and when they do show anything, it\u2019s so well built up. It\u2019s either a reveal at either peak tension or the opposite, when it\u2019s least expected.\n\n(1967) ***Our Mother\u2019s House*** 8/10\n\nJack Clayton, simply for directing The Innocents, is one of my favorite directors. He manages to capture super poignant emotional moments unlike no one else. We have some great modern directors working today that do the same but in terms of 1960's horror, it was harder to come by.\n\n(1967) ***Violated Angels*** 7/10\n\n It\u2019s actually based on an American case, about a man Richard Speck who broke into a hospital in 1966, raped and murdered eight nurses. The cinematography is startling cold. The dialogue is profound and helpless. This has to be up there with the most cynically sexualized piece of exploitation cinema.\n\n(1964) ***Lady in a Cage*** 7.5/10\n\nIt\u2019s a really great little thriller with a solid performance by Olivia de Havilland and also James Caan. I think this movie captures such a helpless nature really well.\n\n(1964) ***The Last Man on Earth*** 7.5/10\n\n I loved this movie. It\u2019s actually one of my favorite Price films, which at least for me, is a bold statement. His films tend to have this warm, campy feel to them but this one actually felt pretty dark and desolate. It still contains those less-serious scenes and bits of dialogue but the writing and ideas themselves feel like a huge leap forward for the horror genre. \n\n(1960) ***The Virgin Spring*** 9/10\n\nThis is clearly the inspiration for The Last House on the Left and while I appreciate that film immensely, it didn\u2019t evoke the same emotions this one did. The cinematography, per-Bergman, is impeccable.\n\n(1958) ***The Fly*** 7.5/10\n\nThe plot is actually non-linear and the first half is my favorite. Patricia Owens plays up the paranoia of her character incredibly well and I was actually really happy to see Price in a supporting role. \n\n(1956) ***Forbidden Planet*** 8/10\n\nI personally think it\u2019s one of the best sci-fi films of the decade. I know I\u2019m going to get chirped for saying this but there\u2019s even a scene towards the end that I believe could have inspired the tesseract in Interstellar.\n\n(1935) ***The Black Room*** 7/10\n\nThis is another Universal horror film starring Karloff, directed by Roy Neill. It presents itself with the usual, tight-knit flair you may have come to expect but it somehow has seen much less recognition than any of the major monster movies. I really liked this movie. \n\n(1932) ***The Old Dark House*** 8/10\n\nThis is also Karloff\u2019s best look to date. I mean seriously, his performance is pretty muted and mostly expressed in body language but he has the same screen presence as Mickey Rourke.",

        "Title": "According to Steven Adams, there was a player in the 2014 draft who boldly stitched the Cavaliers\u2019 logo (who had the no. 1 pick) into his jacket and ended up not getting drafted by them.",
        "Body/Content": "EDIT: I meant 2013 draft, not 2014\n\nCredit to u/KyleNewZealand for bringing up the passage from Adams\u2019 new book in r/Thunder. \n\n> Meanwhile I was a player who, as the analysts would later say, was an unknown until I declared for the draft and went to the NBA Draft Combine testing in Chicago, where draftees are put through a series of physical tests, interviews and scrimmages. This guy only appeared at the combine for the physical measurements, and he was still a solid bet at the number-one pick. He wasn\u2019t at any of the 12 workouts I did for 11 different teams either. He was already famous, while I was desperately working to impress anyone who had the power to hire me. But on that night, I knew exactly what was stitched on the inside of his suit jacket.\n\n\n> Basketball players are tall. Even the shortest are above average height. So when a bunch of basketball players are preparing for one of the biggest nights of their lives, they need a custom-tailored suit. I was sent to an agency that tailored for tall guys like me and asked what I wanted in a suit. To be honest, I just wanted it to fit. They asked what colours represented New Zealand. Damn, how should I know? They suggested green lining to represent the farmland. Sure, why not? For the tie they suggested white stripes to represent milk and dairy farming. It all seemed a bit bougie to me, but I knew nothing about fashion so I just nodded and said that sounded great. The one request I did have was for the New Zealand flag to be stitched into the lining. It wasn\u2019t an unusual request. Some players get their college logo, but I wanted to represent New Zealand through and through.\n\n\n> I was told to collect my suit from the agency the day before the draft. When I walked into the room, the first thing I noticed was a Cleveland Cavaliers singlet laid out with the logo cut out. One of the women told me a player had asked for the Cavaliers\u2019 logo to be sewn into the lining of his jacket. I thought that was bloody brave. No player knows for sure where they\u2019re going to end up and no organisation knows for sure which player they\u2019ll pick until they do it on the night. I had an inkling that I was going to go to Oklahoma City because of the way my visits there had gone, but I would never have dared tell anyone, let alone stitch the Oklahoma City Thunder logo into the lining of my suit.\n\n\n> I needed to know who the man was with the biggest balls in the draft. So while I was looking through the rack for my suit, I had a peek at all the other players\u2019 outfits. All of them were pretty standard until I saw one that had a college team\u2019s singlet number on one side of the lining and on the other was the logo of the Cleveland Cavaliers. I couldn\u2019t believe this guy was that confident, and somehow I knew right then that the Cavaliers wouldn\u2019t pick him first. The universe wouldn\u2019t let anything work out that smoothly. I regretted not putting the logo of the Manawatu Jets basketball team on the other side of my jacket just for shits and giggles. It seemed as appropriate as a Cavaliers logo. When I told my brothers, we all agreed it was a bots move then went back to worrying about my own future.\n\n\n> David Stern came back on stage to announce the first pick. \u2018With the first pick in the 2013 NBA Draft, the Cleveland Cavaliers select Anthony Bennett.\u2019 The whole room gasped. The ESPN guys yelled in surprise. This guy\u2019s table stared at the floor like someone had just died. I\u2019ve never seen a group of people look so disappointed at such a joyous occasion. If the camera had cut to our table, it would have shown all of us with our mouths wide open, trying not to laugh. It was an amazing moment. People seemed to feel sorry for him, but not me. We were all about to be recruited by an NBA team and live our dream. Not one of us deserved anyone\u2019s sympathy. We were the luckiest guys in the world that night.\n\n\n> When this guy was finally selected, I watched as he flashed one side of his jacket and then held the other side shut while he shook David Stern\u2019s hand on stage. There was an audible sigh of relief throughout the room when his name was read out, as if being selected in an NBA draft was some kind of torture.\n\nTL;DR: A player from the 2013 draft who expected to be drafted by the Cavaliers with the no. 1 pick (who we can assume was a lottery pick) stitched the Cavaliers logo into his jacket. The Cavaliers instead ended up drafting Anthony Bennett. \n\nWhat we do know about the guy is that he held the side of his jacket with the Cavaliers logo stitched inside shut, there was an \u201caudible sigh of relief throughout the room when he was drafted, and the player had their college team\u2019s singlet number on the other side of the jacket (which the player apparently flashed out when getting called up). r/Thunder thinks that the player in Nerlens Noel, but could it be someone else?",

        "Title": "A list of Alternate History novels.",
        "Body/Content": "Alternate history or alternative history is a genre of fiction consisting of stories in which one or more historical events occur differently. These stories usually contain \"what if\" scenarios at crucial points in history and present outcomes other than those in the historical record. The stories are conjectural, but are sometimes based on scientific fact. Alternate history can be seen as a subgenre of literary fiction, science fiction, or historical fiction; alternate history works may use tropes from any or all of these genres. \n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a list of some books sorted by their year of publication:\n\n\n\n\nSr. No. | Book | Author | Year of Publication and Description\n---|---|----|----\n1 | **It Can\u2019t Happen Here**  | **Sinclair Lewis**  | (1935) \u2013 United States of America has turned into a fascist state where a President becomes a dictator to save the nation from welfare cheats. Might be considered more a dystopian tale than alternate history, but I am including this here because it\u2019s a good political satire. \n2 | **Lest Darkness Fall**  | **L. Sprague de Camp**  | (1941) \u2013 A lightening flash knocks the protagonist and he wakes up in Rome (right before its fall). His influence changes the events thereafter.\n3 | **The Sound of His Horn**  | **Sarban**  | (1952) \u2013 The protagonist, Alan Querdilion, is captured by the Germans and wakes up in a hospital bed - more than 100 years later. The Germans have won the war, and the Third Reich stretches from the Urals to the Atlantic. This is a weird book though.\n4 | **Bring the Jubilee**  | **Ward Moore**  | (1953) \u2013 What if the South had won the American Civil War? This is one of the most famous alternate history books.\n5 | **Not This August**  | **C. M. Kornbluth**  | (1955) \u2013 The Russians and Chinese overrun the US mainland. A bit dated, but it provides a good yardstick to measure the Cold War era paranoia. \n6 | **The High Crusade**  | **Poul Anderson**  | (1960) - In the year 1345, when England is going to war against France, an alien ship appears and changes the course of history. Could also be classified in the alien-invasion category.\n7 | **The Man in the High Castle**  | **Philip K. Dick**  | (1962) \u2013 Perhaps the most famous book in this list and thus requires no introduction. Read it and watch the on-going tv-series (it\u2019s good).\n8 | **Pavane**  | **Keith Roberts**  | (1968) \u2013 Another popular alternate history book. In the year 1588, Queen Elizabeth was assassinated. That single tragedy set off a whole series of events, resulting in the Spanish Armada's defeat of England and subsequent demise of Protestantism. Now it's the 20th century, and the Church of Rome reigns supreme.\n9 | **All Evil Shed Away**  | **Archie Roy**  | (1970) - In 1969 Germany rules Europe and Africa, Joe McCarthy is President for Life, Japan's empire sprawls across the Pacific, and on a remote Scottish island, Nazi scientists start to experiment with time travel.\n10 | **Operation Chaos**  | **Poul Anderson**  | (1971) \u2013 The book is set in a fantasy alternate history United States where magic and technology combine. In a war waged against black magic, a werewolf and his witch wife are called upon to neutralize an enemy's ultimate weapon--the world's most powerful demon.\n11 | **Death is Lighter Than Feather**  | **David Westheimer**  | (1971) - The author envisions the invasion of Japan that might have occurred had the atomic bomb not been used in 1945.\n12 | **The Iron Dream**  | **Norman Spinrad**  | (1972) \u2013 Adolf Hitler moves to the USA and becomes a science fiction writer instead of becoming the Fuhrer.\n13 | **A Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah!**  | **Harry Harrison**  | (1972) \u2013 An alternate history book by one of my favorite authors. The Transatlantic Tunnel is the greatest engineering feat in the history of the British Empire, a project worthy of Her Majesty's Empire in the eighth decade of the twentieth century. \n14 | **The Ultimate Solution**  | **Eric Norden**  | (1972) \u2013 The story of the last Jew in Nazi America. \n15 | **Gloriana**  | **Michael Moorcock**  | (1977) \u2013 Set in an alternate reality British Empire, Queen Gloriana's reign brings the Empire of Albion into a Golden Age, but her oppressive responsibilities choke her, prohibiting any form of sexual satisfaction, no matter what fetish she tries.\n16 | **And Having Writ\u2026**  | **Donald R. Bensen** | (1978) - In this often overlooked alternate history novel, the Tunguska event was caused by an alien spaceship crashing. The crew manages to land safely and then spend the next few decades changing history as a side-effect of encouraging the creation of technology that can repair their ship.\n17 | **SS \u2013 GB**  | **Len Deighton** | (1978) \u2013 Set in Nazi occupied Britain, a detective of Scotland Yard investigates a murder. A trope that was invented by Deighton, and has been used multiple times ever since.\n18 | **The Moscow Option**  | **David Downing** | (1980) \u2013 What if the Nazis had taken Moscow in 1941?\n19 | **The Mask of the Sun** | **Fred Saberhagen** | (1981) \u2013 A man discovers an Aztec relic, and starts shuttling between past, present and future of an alternate reality.\n20 | **The Leader and the Dead** | **Colin Forbes** | (1983) - Working from the premise that Hitler was murdered in 1943, and replaced by a look-a-like, this story reinterprets the events which took place from 1943 to 1945. At the centre is Martin Bormann, and his plan to cover-up Hitler\u2019s death in an attempt to stop anti-Nazi generals seizing power.\n21 | **Elleander Morning** | **Jerry Yulsman** | (1984) \u2013 This one is another overlooked piece of alternate history. Elleander Morning travels through time to Vienna in 1913, to assassinate a struggling young artist. Adolf Hitler. But 60 years on, long after Elleander has changed the path of the world, a mysterious book - the history of a terrible, global war that never was - threatens to unravel reality.\n22 | **West of Eden** | **Harry Harrison** | (1984) \u2013 The catastrophe that ended the Age of the Dinosaurs 65 million years ago in the world we know never happened.\n23 | **The Proteus Operation** | **James P. Hogan** | (1985) - The victorious fascists had conquered nearly the entire world. Project Proteus offers the only hope: a time gate that made possible a counterstrike back through time.\n24 | **The Architect of Sleep** | **Steven R. Boyett** | (1986) \u2013 The protagonist stumbles through a portal which brings him to an alternate timeline where the raccoons have developed intelligence. This book was the first part of a planned trilogy, but unfortunately, this is the only book we are ever going to get.\n25 | **Team Yankee** | **Harold Coyle** | (1987) \u2013 What if the Cold War escalated into World War \u2013 III?\n26 | **Moon of Ice** | **Brian Linaweaver** | (1988) \u2013 The Nazis have won the war and now the Cold War has ensued between them and the USA.\n27 | **Marching Through Georgia** | **S. M. Stirling** | (1988) - 1942: The Eurasian War. The fleets of Imperial Japan raid the coasts of a United States that stretches from Panama to the Arctic. The Nazi war machine takes Moscow and sweeps east to the Urals. To the south the Domination of the Draka is a giant forge with serf-manned factories pouring out tanks, airplanes and artillery as the Janissary legions gather for the final triumph and revenge. Book 1 in the **Draka series**. 5 books in total.\n28 | **Terraplane** | **Jack Womack** | (1988) - A retired general and his hit-man kidnap a Russian scientist and travel through time to an alternate New York of 1939.\n29 | **Red Army** | **Ralph Peters** | (1989) \u2013 A Cold War novel told entirely from the Russian point of view.\n30 | **V for Vendetta** | **Alan Moore** | (1990) \u2013 Needs no introduction. A graphic novel set in an imagined future England that has given itself over to fascism. The movie is also great.\n31 | **Rally Cry** | **William R. Forstchen** | (1990) - A Union Colonel and his soldiers are swept through a space-time warp, and they find themselves in an alternate world where their rifles are centuries advanced over swords, spears and crossbows. But they also find themselves up against creatures who consider humans mere cattle to sacrifice.\n32 | **WW III** | **Ian Slater** | (1990) \u2013 First book in the **WW III series**. There are a total of 11 books.\n33 | **The Difference Engine** | **William Gibson, Bruce Sterling** | (1990) \u2013 In 1855, the Industrial Revolution is in full swing, powered by steam-driven cybernetic Engines. Charles Babbage perfects his Analytical Engine and the computer age arrives a century ahead of its time.\n34 | **Anno Dracula** | **Kim Newman** | (1992) \u2013 Alternate History with vampires. It is 1888 and Queen Victoria has remarried, taking as her new consort Vlad Tepes, infamously known as Count Dracula. There are other books in the series.\n35 | **Fatherland** | **Robert Harris** | (1992) \u2013 One of the top three alternate history books. Nazis have won the Second World War. Now it\u2019s 1964, one week before Hitler's 75th birthday. Set in Nazi Berlin, this is one of the best books of this sub-genre.\n36 | **The Hammer and the Cross** | **Harry Harrison** | (1993) - 865 A.D. Warring kings rule over the British Isles, but the Church rules over the kings, threatening all who oppose them with damnation. Only the dreaded Vikings of Scandinavia do not fear the priests. Part 1 of the 3 book series.\n37 | **Down in the Bottomlands** | **Harry Turtledove** | (1993) - The Mediterranean basin has dried up several times in the course of earth\u2019s history, only to refill. But what if it hadn't refilled?\n38 | **Mysterium** | **Robert Charles Wilson** | (1994) \u2013 The residents of a town find themselves cut off from the rest of the world and thrust into a new one.\n39 | **In the Balance** | **Harry Turtledove** | (1994) \u2013 World War II is raging. And then the aliens arrive. Total 4 books in the series.\n40 | **The Apocalypse Watch** | **Robert Ludlum** | (1995) \u2013 An American agent penetrates a Neo-Nazi organization. Not a straight up Alternative History book, but if you read it, you\u2019ll know why I have included it here.\n41 | **The Tranquillity Alternative** | **Allen Steele** | (1996) - On the dark side of the moon, six missile silos stand in silence. Today, they will be taken over by corporate interests. Tomorrow, they will be activated.\n42 | **\u201948** | **James Herbert**| (1996) \u2013 Post World War II London is overrun by vampires.\n43 | **Making History** | **Stephen Fry** | (1996) \u2013 A history grad student time travels to prevent Hitler\u2019s conception.\n44 | **Back in the USSA** | **Kim Newman, Eugene Byrne** | (1997) \u2013 Alternate history where USA had a communist revolution instead of Russia.\n45 | **The Moon and the Sun** | **Vonda M. McIntyre** | (1997) \u2013 A fantasy alternate history novel set in seventeenth-century France where Louis XIV rules and sends his natural philosopher on an expedition to seek the source of immortality.\n46 | **Island in the Sea of Time** | **S.

Book 1 of the trilogy in **Arabesk series**.\n55 | **Worlds that Weren\u2019t** | **Harry Turtledove, S.M. Stirling, Mary Gentle, Walter Jon Williams** | (2002) \u2013 Four alternate history novellas.\n56 | **The Separation** | **Christopher Priest** | (2002) \u2013 An alternate history novel about World War II and two identical twin brothers.\n57 | **The Years of Rice and Salt** | **Kim Stanley Robinson** | (2002) \u2013 The black plague wipes out 99% of European population. East rules the world now. A set of characters by death and rebirth see the technological and other advances through 700 years of Earth\u2019s history if East, rather than West had dominated the last few centuries of our history.\n58 | **Hominids** | **Robert J. Sawyer** | (2002) - Neanderthals have developed a radically different civilization on a parallel Earth. A Neanderthal physicist accidentally passes from his universe into a Canadian underground research facility. There are follow-up books in the series.\n59 | **Lion\u2019s Blood** | **Steven Barnes** | (2002) - In an alternate America, the South was colonized by black Africans, and the North by Vikings, who sell abducted Celts and Franks to the Southerners. This book was followed up by **Zulu Heart**.\n60 | **Conquistador** | **S. M.

But through a worm-hole, an alternate 20th century Earth is discovered.\n68 | **Romanitas** | **Sophia McDougall** | (2005) \u2013 First book in the **Romanitas trilogy** where Rome rules most of the world.\n69 | **Ministry of Space** | **Warren Ellis** | (2005) \u2013 Graphic Novel.

But the premise itself warrants its inclusion here. In the early 20th Century, the United States government concocted a plan to import hippopotamuses into the marshlands of Louisiana to be bred and slaughtered as an alternative meat source. This is true. Other true things about hippos: they are savage, they are fast, and their jaws can snap a man in two. The 1890s America that might have been: a bayou overrun by feral hippos and mercenary hippo wranglers from around the globe. It is the story of Winslow Houndstooth and his crew. It is the story of their fortunes. It is the story of his revenge.\n109 | **Summerland** | **Hammu Rajaniemi** | (2017) \u2013 Another book that comes out in 2017. It is 1958. World War II never happened. In the 1930s, the armies of the afterlife - known as Summerland - conquered the world of the living. The ruthless, immortal Summer Lords and their ectoplasmic machines rule a dark Britain with an iron fist. A gifted young medium and a bastard daughter of Harry Houdini discover a map of the Other Side that could break their power. But how do you start a revolution against rulers you cannot escape even in death?\n\n\nDid I miss some books?

        "Title": "The Hockey Universe Remembers Ace Bailey & Mark Bavis, two Kings Scouts who aboard United Airlines Flight 175 that struck the South Tower, Two World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.",
        "Body/Content": "# Remembering September 11, 2001\n\nOn September 11, 2001 the world was shocked witnessing a terrorist attack against the United States Of America.\n\nHijackers took control of four commercial airliners and struck the both Twin Towers at the World Trade Center in New York City, New York, and the Headquarters of the United States Department of Defense, The Pentagon, in Arlington County, Virginia, while a fourth target The US Capitol Building was saved after it crashed near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after the passengers fought the hijackers.\n\nEveryone has their stories that they\u2019ll never forget about where they were when they heard the news (I myself was just waking up getting ready to work at the Long Beach Arena for the LA Times Travel Show), but the effects of the attacks were so wide-reaching.\n\nAmong the 2,977 victims of these attacks were two members of the Hockey Universe:\n\n***Garnet \u201cAce\u201d Bailey*** and ***Mark Bavis*** were scouts for the Los Angeles Kings who were aboard United Airlines Flight 175 that struck the South Tower, Two World Trade Center.\n\nAs the 2001 season was rapidly approaching, Bailey and Bavis were at different stages of their careers, with Bailey, 53, the seasoned pro and Bavis, 31, the youngster on the rise.\n\n***Garnet Edward Bailey*** was born in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan. \n\nBailey spent 11 seasons playing pro hockey beginning as the 13th overall draft pick by the Boston Bruins in 1966 and was on their Stanley Cup Champion teams in 1970 & 1972, he also had stops with the Detroit Red Wings, St. Louis Blues, and Washington Capitals he spent the 1978-79 season with the World Hockey Association's Edmonton Oilers, where he mentored a teenage rookie from Brantford, Ontario\n\nThat player was Wayne Gretzky.\n\n\u201cI was more like a son to him than a teammate,\u201d Gretzky recalls in an interview. \u201cAce may have not been the greatest athlete to play in the NHL, but he taught many players how to be champions, and more importantly, he was a winner as a person.\n\nAs well as living with the Bailey's, Gretzky roomed with Bailey on the road and the two became fast friends. \u201cI could count on seeing Ace or my dad or both of them in the stands,\u201d Gretzky said. \u201c\\[Ace\\] had a huge influence because, listen, every human - everyone - has his bad days. You know, Ace had that influence on me because he knew the position that I was going to be in, that people didn\u2019t want to hear me having a bad day or a bad time. He taught me a lot about dealing with fans and people, but also about dealing with the media and things like that.\u201d\n\nYears later, Bailey would join his old friend with the Kings organization.\n\nAfter his playing days ended in the Central Hockey League, Bailey turned to Coaching in 1980 with Wichita, Edmonton\u2019s CHL affiliate, then moved into Player Scouting within the Oilers organization from 1981 to 1994, where he won five Stanley Cup rings as a scout (1984\u201385\u201387\u201388\u201390). And his name is engraved with the \u201885, \u201887 and \u201890 Oilers teams\n\nBailey was the Kings Director of Pro Scouting for seven season when he was killed, he spent 32 seasons in the NHL.\n\n***Mark Lawrence Bavis***  was entering his second season as an Amateur Scout for the Kings at his death, he was 31.\n\nBorn in Roslindale, Massachusetts Bavis played college hockey locally at Boston University as a forward and played in the NCAA Tournament four times for the Terriers; three trips to the semi-finals and one championship game against Northern Michigan in 1991. He twice shared the Bennett McInnis Memorial Award for Team Spirit with his twin brother, Mike.\n\nA ninth-round draft pick of the New York Rangers in 1989, Mark played three years in the American Hockey League \u2013 Binghamton, Frederick, and Providence \u2013 then two seasons with the South Carolina Stingrays of the East Coast Hockey League, the first of which was memorable because Mark and Mike were together again, team mates for the last time.\n\nBriefly joining the coaching ranks, Bavis was an assistant coach at Harvard. Prior to joining the Kings he worked as a coach with Chicago of the North American League and as an Assistant Coach with Harvard of the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and in the junior-level North American League.\n\nBavis joined the Kings in 2000 and made an impact. Bavis\u2019 responsibilities included scouting NCAA hockey, and in June 2001 -- Bavis\u2019 only draft as a member of the Kings\u2019 staff -- the Kings used first-round draft picks on a pair of college kids, at Bavis\u2019 urging.\n\nThe Kings took David Steckel in the first round with the 30th pick and Michael Cammalleri in the second round (49th overall).\n\nBoth players retired after the 2017-18 season;\n\nSteckel played over 400 games and hung up his skates as a member of the Thomas Sabo Ice Tigers of the German Elite League having played for the Kings, Washington Capitals, New Jersey Devils, Toronto Maple Leafs and Anaheim Ducks, while Cammalleri ended his 906 game career with the Oilers after stints with the Kings, Devils, Calgary Flames, and the Montreal Canadiens scoring 294 goals and 348 assists (642 Pts).\n\nBavis helped give them their start by urging Kings staff to draft them in his only NHL Draft for the Kings.\n\n\u201cHe had a good eye,\u201d Dave Taylor, a Kings alumnus, who currently serves as Vice President of Hockey Operations with the 2019 Stanley Cup Champion St. Louis Blues, and who served as Kings general manager then, said in 2011. \u201cHe understood the game and he worked hard at it. I think he would have had a tremendous future. He just had a passion for hockey.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was a tough day for the Kings organization, for sure, and probably the toughest day I\u2019ve ever had in the hockey business\u201d Taylor said. \u201cProbably the toughest day I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nAs the Kings staff worked that Tuesday on Preseason 2001, news from the East trickled in. A plane hit the World Trade Center. Then a second plane. One of the flights had come from Boston\u2019s Logan Airport.\n\n\u201cI was supposed to be on United Airlines flight 175 out of Boston,\u201d former head coach of the Capitals, Ducks, and Minnesota Wild, Bruce Boudreau, then-coach of the then AHL Manchester Monarchs, the Kings Minor League Affiliate in 2001, wrote in his 2009 autobiography, \u2018Gabby - Confessions of a Hockey Lifer.'\n\n\u201cThe original itinerary called for me to be on the Tuesday flight from Boston to Los Angeles for the start of Kings training camp. But Kings head coach Andy Murray decided he wanted me and Bobby Jay, my Manchester assistant coach, there a day earlier\u2026. Thank God Kings general manager Dave Taylor listened to coaches when they wanted something. The week before, John Wolf, Taylor\u2019s assistant, told me he changed my flight because Murray had scheduled a precamp meeting and dinner with all the coaches in the organization. I would fly to LA on Monday, September 10, instead of Tuesday, September 11. I wasn\u2019t peeved about the switch. I was happy that Andy wanted me there early. I didn\u2019t know he had saved my life.\u201d\n\nThe weekend before September 11, Kings player personnel director Bill O\u2019Flaherty\u2019s daughter got married in Lake Placid, New York. Ace Bailey picked up Gabby as Bruce was called, in Manchester, New Hampshire, and drove to Lake Placid.\n\n\u201cWe returned home Sunday morning,\u201d Bruce writes. \u201cI suggested to Ace that he get his Tuesday flight changed to Monday and travel to LA with me. Ace checked with John Wolf. (All of the Kings Staff travel had been coordinated by Wolf, the Kings\u2019 longtime assistant to the general manager.) A flight change would cost $750. Ace didn\u2019t want to hit the Kings with that expense and opted to stick with the Tuesday flight. He dropped me off and I shook his hand, gave him a man hug, and told him I\u2019d see him Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI flew to Los Angeles on Monday with Bobby Jay, and on Tuesday morning, September 11, at around 6:00 a.m. Pacific time, my wife, Crystal, phoned and told me to turn on the TV. I did and saw all the stuff happening with the terrorist attacks. I went to Bobby Jay\u2019s room. He\u2019s from Boston. We went to the rink to continue watching and word started to drift out that one of the planes involved was United flight 175\u2014the flight taken by Bailey and Mark.\u201d\n\nImmediately, the news brought an ominous feel to the Kings\u2019 office. Scouts were scheduled to arrive that day from all parts of the world.\n\nWolf knew that Bailey and Bavis had been booked on United 175, on one of the planes that, according to widespread media reports, had crashed into the Two World Trade Center.\n\nOfficially, the Kings couldn\u2019t be 100-percent certain. Taylor made repeated calls to United Airlines and, for hours, was told only that the flight was \u201cmissing.\u201d\n\nEveryone hoped for the best -- Maybe a late reservation change? Maybe the guys overslept? But before long, Taylor could no longer avoid the staggering truth.\n\n\u201cI called both guys\u2019 cell phones a number of times over the course of the day, just sort of hoping that they would answer,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cBut I never heard back, and when I talked to Kathy Bailey \\[Ace\u2019s wife\\], she said, \u2018Dave, I know Ace was on that plane. I dropped him off at the airport.\u2019 It was just so sad and so devastating for everybody.\u201d\n\nWolf quietly broke the news, to staff members, that Bailey and Bavis had been among the victims. The task of announcing the scouts\u2019 death fell to Taylor.\n\n\u201cI addressed the team,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI broke the news to them about what had happened, that we had lost two family members on that flight. I had a real hard time speaking, and \\[then-coach\\] Andy Murray actually cut the meeting short at that point.\u201d\n\nTaylor\u2019s message, while brief, was poignant. It was a tribute not only to Bailey and Bavis but to all the scouts, all the men who work hard, countless hours -- living out of suitcases, scarfing down fast food, away from their families for weeks at a time.\n\nTaylor wanted the players to know that while the scouts don\u2019t spend much time around the team during the season, they remain part of the extended family of an NHL team.\n\n\u201cThat was monumental, for him to have to tell everybody that we lost two of our guys,\u201d Demers said. \u201cIt was the most courageous thing Dave Taylor ever had to do.\u201d\n\nThe Kings\u2019 lion mascot, Bailey, is named in Ace\u2019s memory, the AM memorial patch for Ace and Mark the Kings wore for the 2001-2002 season adorns every Kings jersey he has worn since his debut in 2007.\n\nDenis Leary, a big hockey fan, wore a Ace Bailey memorial shirt on one episode of his FX show \u201cRescue Me\u201d.\n\nThe Dropkick Murphys, a punk rock band out of Quincy, MA, wrote a song mention Ace and Mark, in the song \u201cYour Spirit\u2019s Alive\u201d which they sing;\n\n*\u201cFarewell my brother.You\u2019re off to the big rink in the sky.The good Lord\u2019s between the pipes.And you\u2019ve got Bavis and Ace on the wing.\u201d*\n\nBailey and Bavis have legacies that live on, through foundations in their names.\n\nThe Ace Bailey Children\u2019s Foundation -- [www.AceBailey.org](https://www.AceBailey.org) \\-- seeks to build and renovate space in hospitals to make them more comforting to young patients.\n\nThe Mark Bavis Leadership Foundation -- [www.MarkBavisLeadershipFoundation.org](https://www.MarkBavisLeadershipFoundation.org) \\-- raises money in order to award grants to students for tuition and extracurricular activities.\n\nAce\u2019s and Mark\u2019s names are inscribed in the South Pool on Panel S-3 of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City along with the rest of the Passengers of Flight 175 are inscribed on the South Pool, on Panels S-2, S-3, and S-4.\n\nWhen the Kings won the Stanley Cup in June 2012, David Krasne, a Kings fan living in New York went to the memorial on the day of the Kings\u2019 Championship Parade to pay his respects and put his Stanley Cup Championship Cap between Ace and Mark\u2019s inscriptions;\n\n\u201cAs a Kings fan in NYC,\u201d Krasne sent to LA Times Sports columnist Helene Elliott and Jon Rosen at LA Kings Insider via Twitter, \u201cI couldn\u2019t let Mark Bavis or Ace Bailey miss the festivities.\u201d\n\n\u201cMay Mark Bavis \\[&\\] Ace Bailey finally RIP\u201d He said in a later tweet to John \u201cFive For Fighting\u201d Ondrasik and Kings mascot, Bailey.\n\nWhen the Kings returned as Stanley Cup Champions June 13th, 2014, David again returned to the September 11 Memorial with a new cap.\n\n\u201c\u2026 Never have I been more proud to be a LA Kings fan,\u201d He posted to his Facebook Account the next day. \u201c\u2026. Once again, I couldn\u2019t let Garnet \u201cAce\u201d Bailey and Mark Bavis miss out on the festivities....They played a role in building this franchise to where it is today. We will never forget you.\u201d",

        "Title": "The body on Somerton Beach - a body found in 1948 with a mysterious scrap of paper sewn into a secret pocket.",
        "Body/Content": "From [Smithsonian Mag](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-body-on-somerton-beach-50795611/)\n\nMost murders aren\u2019t that difficult to solve. The husband did it. The wife did it. The boyfriend did it, or the ex-boyfriend did. The crimes fit a pattern, the motives are generally clear.\n\nOf course, there are always a handful of cases that don\u2019t fit the template, where the killer is a stranger or the reason for the killing is bizarre. It\u2019s fair to say, however, that nowadays the authorities usually have something to go on. Thanks in part to advances such as DNA technology, the police are seldom baffled anymore.\n\n\nThey certainly were baffled, though, in Adelaide, the capital of South Australia, in December 1948. And the only thing that seems to have changed since then is that a story that began simply\u2014with the discovery of a body on the beach on the first day of that southern summer\u2014has bec0me ever more mysterious. In fact, this case (which remains, theoretically at least, an active investigation) is so opaque that we still do not know the victim\u2019s identity, have no real idea what killed him, and cannot even be certain whether his death was murder or suicide.\n\nWhat we can say is that the clues in the Somerton Beach mystery (or the enigma of the \u201cUnknown Man,\u201d as it is known Down Under) add up to one of the world\u2019s most perplexing cold cases. It may be the most mysterious of them all.\n\nLet\u2019s start by sketching out the little that is known for certain. At 7 o\u2019clock on the warm evening of Tuesday, November 30, 1948, jeweler John Bain Lyons and his wife went for a stroll on Somerton Beach, a seaside resort a few miles south of Adelaide. As they walked toward Glenelg, they noticed a smartly dressed man lying on the sand, his head propped against a sea wall. He was lolling about 20 yards from them, legs outstretched, feet crossed. As the couple watched, the man extended his right arm upward, then let it fall back to the ground. Lyons thought he might be making a drunken attempt to smoke a cigarette.\n\n\nHalf an hour later, another couple noticed the same man lying in the same position. Looking on him from above, the woman could see that he was immaculately dressed in a suit, with smart new shoes polished to a mirror shine\u2014odd clothing for the beach. He was motionless, his left arm splayed out on the sand. The couple decided that he was simply asleep, his face surrounded by mosquitoes. \u201cHe must be dead to the world not to notice them,\u201d the boyfriend joked.\n\nIt was not until next morning that it became obvious that the man was not so much dead to the world as actually dead. John Lyons returned from a morning swim to find some people clustered at the seawall where he had seen his \u201cdrunk\u201d the previous evening. Walking over, he saw a figure slumped in much the same position, head resting on the seawall, feet crossed. Now, though, the body was cold. There were no marks of any sort of violence. A half-smoked cigarette was lying on the man\u2019s collar, as though it had fallen from his mouth.\n\nThe body reached the Royal Adelaide Hospital three hours later. There Dr. John Barkley Bennett put the time of death at no earlier than 2 a.m., noted the likely cause of death as heart failure, and added that he suspected poisoning. The contents of the man\u2019s pockets were spread out on a table: tickets from Adelaide to the beach, a pack of chewing gum, some matches, two combs and a pack of Army Club cigarettes containing seven cigarettes of another, more expensive brand called Kensitas. There was no wallet and no cash, and no ID. None of the man\u2019s clothes bore any name tags\u2014indeed, in all but one case the maker\u2019s label had been carefully snipped away. One trouser pocket had been neatly repaired with an unusual variety of orange thread.\n\n\nBy the time a full autopsy was carried out a day later, the police had already exhausted their best leads as to the dead man\u2019s identity, and the results of the postmortem did little to enlighten them. It revealed that the corpse\u2019s pupils were \u201csmaller\u201d than normal and \u201cunusual,\u201d that a dribble of spittle had run down the side of the man\u2019s mouth as he lay, and that \u201che was probably unable to swallow it.\u201d His spleen, meanwhile, \u201cwas strikingly large and firm, about three times normal size,\u201d and the liver was distended with congested blood.\n\nIn the man\u2019s stomach, pathologist John Dwyer found the remains of his last meal\u2014a pasty\u2014and a further quantity of blood. That too suggested poisoning, though there was nothing to show that the poison had been in the food. Now the dead man\u2019s peculiar behavior on the beach\u2014slumping in a suit, raising and dropping his right arm\u2014seemed less like drunkenness than it did a lethal dose of something taking slow effect. But repeated tests on both blood and organs by an expert chemist failed to reveal the faintest trace of a poison. \u201cI was astounded that he found nothing,\u201d Dwyer admitted at the inquest. In fact, no cause of death was found.\n\nThe body displayed other peculiarities. The dead man\u2019s calf muscles were high and very well developed; although in his late 40s, he had the legs of an athlete. His toes, meanwhile, were oddly wedge-shaped. One expert who gave evidence at the inquest noted:\n\nI have not seen the tendency of calf muscle so pronounced as in this case\u2026. His feet were rather striking, suggesting\u2014this is my own assumption\u2014that he had been in the habit of wearing high-heeled and pointed shoes.\n\n\nPerhaps, another expert witness hazarded, the dead man had been a ballet dancer?\n\nThe mystery gets stranger after the jump.\n\nAll this left the Adelaide coroner, Thomas Cleland, with a real puzzle on his hands. The only practical solution, he was informed by an eminent professor, Sir Cedric Stanton Hicks, was that a very rare poison had been used\u2014one that \u201cdecomposed very early after death,\u201d leaving no trace. The only poisons capable of this were so dangerous and deadly that Hicks would not say their names aloud in open court. Instead, he passed Cleland a scrap of paper on which he had written the names of two possible candidates: digitalis and strophanthin. Hicks suspected the latter. Strophanthin is a rare glycoside derived from the seeds of some African plants. Historically, it was used by a little-known Somali tribe to poison arrows.\n\n\nMore baffled than ever now, the police continued their investigation. A full set of fingerprints was taken and circulated throughout Australia\u2014and then throughout the English-speaking world. No one could identify them. People from all over Adelaide were escorted to the mortuary in the hope they could give the corpse a name. Some thought they knew the man from photos published in the newspapers, others were the distraught relatives of missing persons. Not one recognized the body.\n\nBy January 11, the South Australia police had investigated and dismissed pretty much every lead they had. The investigation was now widened in an attempt to locate any abandoned personal possessions, perhaps left luggage, that might suggest that the dead man had come from out of state. This meant checking every hotel, dry cleaner, lost property office and railway station for miles around. But it did produce results. On the 12th, detectives sent to the main railway station in Adelaide were shown a brown suitcase that had been deposited in the cloakroom there on November 30.\n\n\nThe suitcase left by the dead man at Adelaide Station \u2013 with some of its perplexing contents\n\nThe staff could remember nothing about the owner, and the case\u2019s contents were not much more revealing. The case did contain a reel of orange thread identical to that used to repair the dead man\u2019s trousers, but painstaking care had been applied to remove practically every trace of the owner\u2019s identity. The case bore no stickers or markings, and a label had been torn off from one side. The tags were missing from all but three items of the clothing inside; these bore the name \u201cKean\u201d or \u201cT. Keane,\u201d but it proved impossible to trace anyone of that name, and the police concluded\u2013an Adelaide newspaper reported\u2013that someone \u201chad purposely left them on, knowing that the dead man\u2019s name was not \u2018Kean\u2019 or \u2018Keane.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\nThe remainder of the contents were equally inscrutable. There was a stencil kit of the sort \u201cused by the Third Officer on merchant ships responsible for the stenciling of cargo\u201d; a table knife with the haft cut down; and a coat stitched using a feather stitch unknown in Australia. A tailor identified the stitchwork as American in origin, suggesting that the coat, and perhaps its wearer, had traveled during the war years. But searches of shipping and immigration records from across the country again produced no likely leads.\n\nThe police had brought in another expert, John Cleland, emeritus professor of pathology at the University of Adelaide, to re-examine the corpse and the dead man\u2019s possessions. In April, four months after the discovery of the body, Cleland\u2019s search produced a final piece of evidence\u2014one that would prove to be the most baffling of all. Cleland discovered a small pocket sewn into the waistband of the dead man\u2019s trousers. Previous examiners had missed it, and several accounts of the case have referred to it as a \u201csecret pocket,\u201d but it seems to have been intended to hold a fob watch. Inside, tightly rolled, was a minute scrap of paper, which, opened up, proved to contain two words, typeset in an elaborate printed script. The phrase read \u201cTam\u00e1m Shud.\u201d\n\n\nThe scrap of paper discovered in a concealed pocket in the dead man's trousers. 'Tam\u00e1m shud' is a Persian phrase; it means 'It is ended.' The words had been torn from a rare New Zealand edition of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.\n\nFrank Kennedy, the police reporter for the Adelaide Advertiser, recognized the words as Persian, and telephoned the police to suggest they obtain a copy of a book of poetry\u2014the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. This work, written in the twelfth century, had become popular in Australia during the war years in a much-loved translation by Edward FitzGerald. It existed in numerous editions, but the usual intricate police enquiries to libraries, publishers and bookshops failed to find one that matched the fancy type. At least it was possible, however, to say that the words \u201cTam\u00e1m shud\u201d (or \u201cTaman shud,\u201d as several newspapers misprinted it\u2014a mistake perpetuated ever since) did come from Khayyam\u2019s romantic reflections on life and mortality. They were, in fact, the last words in most English translations\u2014 not surprisingly, because the phrase means \u201cIt is ended.\u201d\n\n\nTaken at face value, this new clue suggested that the death might be a case of suicide; in fact, the South Australia police never did turn their \u201cmissing person\u201d enquiries into a full-blown murder investigation. But the discovery took them no closer to identifying the dead man, and in the meantime his body had begun to decompose. Arrangements were made for a burial, but\u2014conscious that they were disposing of one of the few pieces of evidence they had\u2014the police first had the corpse embalmed, and a cast taken of the head and upper torso. After that, the body  was buried, sealed under concrete in a plot of dry ground specifically chosen in case it became necessary to exhume it. As late as 1978, flowers would be found at odd intervals on the grave, but no one could ascertain who had left them there, or why.\n\n\nThe dead man's copy of the Rubaiyat, from a contemporary press photo. No other copy of the book matching this one has ever been located.\n\nIn July, fully eight months after the investigation had begun, the search for the right Rubaiyat produced results. On the 23rd, a Glenelg man walked into the Detective Office in Adelaide with a copy of the book and a strange story. Early the previous December, just after the discovery of the unknown body, he had gone for a drive with his brother-in-law in a car he kept parked a few hundred yards from Somerton Beach. The brother-in-law had found a copy of the Rubaiyat lying on the floor by the rear seats. Each man had silently assumed it belonged to the other, and the book had sat in the glove compartment ever since. Alerted by a newspaper article about the search, the two men had gone back to take a closer look. They found that part of the final page had been torn out, together with Khayyam\u2019s final words. They went to the police.\n\nDetective Sergeant Lionel Leane took a close look at the book. Almost at once he found a telephone number penciled on the rear cover; using a magnifying glass, he dimly made out the faint impression of some other letters, written in capitals underneath. Here, at last, was a solid clue to go on.\n\n\nThe phone number was unlisted, but it proved to belong to a young nurse who lived near Somerton Beach. Like the two Glenelg men, she has never been publicly identified\u2014the South Australia police of 1949 were disappointingly willing to protect witnesses embarrassed to be linked to the case\u2014and she is now known only by her nickname, Jestyn. Reluctantly, it seemed (perhaps because she was living with the man who would become her husband), the nurse admitted that she had indeed presented a copy of the Rubaiyat to a man she had known during the war. She gave the detectives his name: Alfred Boxall.\n\nAt last the police felt confident that they had solved the mystery. Boxall, surely, was the Unknown Man. Within days they traced his home to Maroubra, New South Wales.\n\nThe problem was that Boxall turned out to be still alive, and he still had the copy of the Rubaiyat Jestyn had given him. It bore the nurse\u2019s inscription, but was completely intact. The scrap of paper hidden in the dead man\u2019s pocket must have come from somewhere else.\n\n\nIt might have helped if the South Australia police had felt able to question Jestyn closely, but it is clear that they did not. The gentle probing that the nurse received did yield some intriguing bits of information; interviewed again, she recalled that some time the previous year\u2014she could not be certain of the date\u2014she had come home to be told by neighbors than an unknown man had called and asked for her. And, confronted with the cast of the dead man\u2019s face, Jestyn seemed \u201ccompletely taken aback, to the point of giving the appearance she was about to faint,\u201d Leane said. She seemed to recognize the man, yet firmly denied that he was anyone she knew.\n\n\nThe code revealed by examination of the dead man's Rubaiyat under ultraviolet light.  It has yet to be cracked.\n\nThat left the faint impression Sergeant Leane had noticed in the Glenelg Rubaiyat. Examined under ultraviolet light, five lines of jumbled letters could be seen, the second of which had been crossed out. The first three were separated from the last two by a pair of straight lines with an \u2018x\u2019 written over them. It seemed that they were some sort of code.\n\nBreaking a code from only a small fragment of text is exceedingly difficult, but the police did their best. They sent the message to Naval Intelligence, home to the finest cipher experts in Australia, and allowed the message to be published in the press. This produced a frenzy of amateur codebreaking, almost all of it worthless, and a message from the Navy concluding that the code appeared unbreakable:\n\nFrom the manner in which the lines have been represented as being set out in the original, it is evident that the end of each line indicates a break in sense.\n\nThere is an insufficient number of letters for definite conclusions to be based on analysis, but the indications together with the acceptance of the above breaks in sense indicate, in so far as can be seen, that the letters do not constitute any kind of simple cipher or code.\n\nThe frequency of the occurrence of letters, whilst inconclusive, corresponds more favourably with the table of frequencies of initial letters of words in English than with any other table; accordingly a reasonable explanation would be that the lines are the initial letters of words of a verse of poetry or such like.\n\n\nAnd there, to all intents and purposes, the mystery rested. The Australian police never cracked the code or identified the unknown man. Jestyn died a few years ago without revealing why she had seemed likely to faint when confronted with a likeness of the dead man\u2019s face. And when the South Australia coroner published the final results of his investigation in 1958, his report concluded with the admission:\n\nI am unable to say who the deceased was\u2026 I am unable to say how he died or what was the cause of death.\n\nIn recent years, though, the Tam\u00e1m Shud case has begun to attract new attention. Amateur sleuths have probed at the loose ends left by the police, solving one or two minor mysteries but often creating new ones in their stead. And two especially persistent investigators\u2014retired Australian policeman Gerry Feltus, author of the only book yet published on the case, and Professor Derek Abbott of the University of Adelaide\u2014have made particularly useful progress. Both freely admit they have not solved mystery\u2014but let\u2019s close by looking briefly at the remaining puzzles and leading theories.\n\nFirst, the man\u2019s identity remains unknown. It is generally presumed that he was known to Jestyn, and may well have been the man who called at her apartment, but even if he was not, the nurse\u2019s shocked response when confronted with the body cast was telling. Might the solution be found in her activities during World War II? Was she in the habit of presenting men friends with copies of the Rubaiyat, and, if so, might the dead man have been a former boyfriend, or more, whom she did not wish to confess to knowing? Abbott\u2019s researches certainly suggest as much, for he has traced Jestyn\u2019s identity and discovered that she had a son. Minute analysis of the surviving photos of the Unknown Man and Jestyn\u2019s child reveals intriguing similarities. Might the dead man have been the father of the son? If so, could he have killed himself when told he could not see them?\n\n\nThose who argue against this theory point to the cause of the man\u2019s death. How credible is it, they say, that someone would commit suicide by dosing himself with a poison of real rarity? Digitalis, and even strophanthin, can be had from pharmacies, but never off the shelf\u2014both poisons are muscle relaxants used to treat heart disease. The apparently exotic nature of the death suggests, to these theorists, that the Unknown Man was possibly a spy. Alfred Boxall had worked in intelligence during the war, and the Unknown Man died, after all, at the onset of the Cold War, and at a time when the British rocket testing facility at Woomera, a few hundred miles from Adelaide, was one of the most secret bases in the world. It has even been suggested that poison was administered to him via his tobacco. Might this explain the mystery of why his Army Club pack contained seven Kensitas cigarettes?\n\nFar-fetched as this seems, there are two more genuinely odd things about the mystery of Tam\u00e1m Shud that point away from anything so mundane as suicide.\n\nThe first is the apparent impossibility of locating an exact duplicate of the Rubaiyat handed in to the police in July 1949. Exhaustive enquiries by Gerry Feltus at last tracked down a near-identical version, with the same cover, published by a New Zealand bookstore chain named Whitcombe & Tombs. But it was published in a squarer format.\n\n\nAdd to that one of Derek Abbott\u2019s leads, and the puzzle gets yet more peculiar. Abbott has discovered that at least one other man died in Australia after the war with a copy of Khayyam\u2019s poems close by him. This man\u2019s name was George Marshall, he was a Jewish immigrant from Singapore, and his copy of the Rubaiyat was published in London by Methuen\u2014 a seventh edition.\n\nSo far, so not especially peculiar. But inquiries to the publisher, and to libraries around the world, suggest that there were never more than five editions of Methuen\u2019s Rubaiyat\u2014which means that Marshall\u2019s seventh edition was as nonexistent as the Unknown Man\u2019s Whitcombe & Tombs appears to be. Might the books not have been books at all, but disguised spy gear of some sort\u2014say one-time code pads?\n\nWhich brings us to the final mystery. Going through the police file on the case, Gerry Feltus stumbled across a neglected piece of evidence: a statement, given in 1959, by a man who had been on Somerton Beach. There, on the evening that the Unknown Man expired, and walking toward the spot where his body was found, the witness (a police report stated) \u201csaw a man carrying another on his shoulder, near the water\u2019s edge. He could not describe the man.\u201d\n\n\nAt the time, this did not seem that mysterious; the witness assumed he\u2019d seen somebody carrying a drunken friend. Looked at in the cold light of day, though, it raises  questions. After all, none of the people who saw a man lying on the seafront earlier had noticed his face. Might he not have been the Unknown Man at all? Might the body found next morning have been the one seen on the stranger\u2019s shoulder? And, if so, might this conceivably suggest this really was a case involving spies\u2014and murder?",

        "Body/Content": "Time to stir up some Hu Tao love once again \u2013 in case you forgot how wonderful of a character she is. I wrote a Hu Tao writeup for a competition a few days ago that I wanted to share here! :) (this time it's not 10,000 words do not worry)\n\nHu Tao is one of the most well-developed, complex characters we have in Genshin that also exists relatively 'contained' in the story and I will not stop writing about her. Note that I know a ton of people here love Rie Takahashi's interpretation of Hu Tao, but I'm biased towards the English characterization of her (using CN source material everywhere else, please don't roast) which is a lot more solemn/serious. **There's some serious Hu Tao mischaracterization and reduction of her personality, so I hope this writeup helps put things into perspective.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/utcyquso5su61.png?width=1374&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ec426b4277a9224a5df22fb81320bfe40f37c7b\n\n*\u201cLife leads unto death, and death unto new life \u2014 why, then, should death be taboo?\"*\n\nEccentric yet reverent, the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor stands at the border between life and death \u2013\u2013 and it is precisely because of this does she understand that in a cyclic world, we must draw wonder. Underneath her whimsy, Hu Tao is a reverent funeral director, influential poet, and spirit soother carrying the rituals that had once cleansed the karmic evils of Liyue's fallen gods.\n\n# APPEARANCE: The Equinox Flower, Butterflies, and Old Hu\n\nA young lady outfitted in the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor attire with sanguine eyes in the shape of flowers, with a blazing spirit by her in combat.\n\nHu Tao wears her '**Harmony Hexagram Hat**', originally owned by her late grandfather. Adorned with a talisman bearing the insignia of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor and red plum blossoms (*Prunus mume*; one of the most popular flora in Chinese culture), symbolic of life's impermanence and revolutionary struggle as it characteristically signals the transition of winter towards summer. The pink/red plum blossoms are most often used during the Chinese New Year, where perseverance is celebrated while death and negativity are taboo, ironic.\n\n\"This hat is magical, upholding good and repelling evil, and is a bringer of peace!\" Incredibly protective and attached, in truth, Hu Tao had spent an entire night and day fashioning the 75th's hat to fit her head. Its plum blossoms and branches tucked to the side had been carefully plucked from a plum tree that Hu Tao had tended herself in careful process: plant, pluck, air-dry, paint, lacquer, outline, sun-dry (for three days) \u2013\u2013 as regimented as the rituals she performs in her day-to-day job.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g6nwdggt5su61.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec5a9413a460e23be49bee2bd7b0efe534144321\n\nOn the back of Hu Tao's coat are the silhouettes of an *equinox flower* (*Lycoris radiata*) and *butterfly*.\n\n**Equinox flowers** are often used in funerals in Japanese culture, and are taken as 'flowers of hell' in Chinese Buddhism \u2013 in both cultures, they're rumored to hail from the underworld as they bloom around the roads of hell, guiding mortal men towards reincarnation in the endless cycle of death and rebirth. In practice, equinox bulbs are incredibly poisonous. Before cremation was widespread, these flowers were planted in graveyards as a deterrent to wild animals who feasted in corpses. **\ud83d\udcf7**\n\nThe **butterfly** is a near-universal metaphor for reincarnation, life-and-death, courage, and immortality \u2013 a carrier of the human's self and soul. When associated with plum blossoms, this visage of longevity is furthered. Culturally, butterflies are messengers, epitomic of eternal life. Other cultures take them as the spirits of passed relatives and loved ones.\n\nIn Taoism, the famous parable ***Zhuangzi's Butterfly Dream*** grapples with the dichotomy of the self and ego, bodily immortality and spiritual enlightenment. In the parable, a man dreams of himself a butterfly, waking up without knowing whether he had dreamed he was a butterfly or a butterfly now dreaming of himself as a man \u2013 such is the Transformation of Things. Itself a contradiction and transformative paradox, when is one dreaming and when is one awake? These larger themes play into Genshin Impact's motifs of dreams and truth, expressed down to the details of Hu Tao's funerary attire.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# PERSONALITY: Beyond whimsy and wisdom\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erg5fy4u5su61.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=a02b63e63c13348e39752af23aa47e1f1c000353\n\n*\u201cTa da ta da, you've been pranked!\"*\n\nFrom Qiqi's misinformed (yet justifiable) disdain (\"punch-able face\"), Xiangling's annoyance at her antics, to all of Liyue's rumors and fears about her name and Wangsheng's dealings\u2026 how could one ever expect a seemingly lackadaisical, chaotic prankster be the one carrying Liyue's funeral affairs?\n\n**On the surface, Hu Tao is a prankster and free spirit** with antics spread all over Liyue (and its message boards) that have earned her a level of derision and annoyance from the town (\"*Whenever someone mentions Hu Tao, their neighbors find it extremely hard to navigate the conversation.*\"). She brings buckets filled of water to bathe stone statues at the very front of Liyue's Ministry of Civil Affairs to the confusion of crowds, only to disappear as suddenly as she arrives to the disappointment of the millelith. She plays four-player card games by herself for hours and stalks through the mountains with any ounce of time she gets. She teases, perfectly content with weird looks and distrust from her own employees \u2013 as if fully aware of how her unique personality is immensely jarring.\n\n*\u201cUgh, how can you call me a weirdo? I mean, wouldn't you say it's more... charmingly naive? Or... disarmingly different?\"*\n\n**Beyond the precocious behavior however, is a woman who abides by these rules: \"*****live in life, die in death*****.\"** With life so fleeting and death so inevitable, why waste a single second not living it to the fullest? Hu Tao is immaculate in conduct, precise in the parlor's rituals, and stern about death's role in mortal life. \"*Only once you know and respect death can you truly understand the value of life.*\"\n\nHer close proximity to death has brought her this wisdom, but it also hasn't erased her own human fears. Along the border, Hu Tao hints at her own fears of death. \"Sitting around doing nothing is a fate worse than death,\" she says, rejecting fatality whilst still cautious of the end.\n\n*\u201cSitting around doing nothing is a fate worse than death.\"*\n\nDeath is one of the only constants that Hu Tao knows, **yet she still tread across the spirit realm** in search of her grandfather in hopes that he had somehow stepped out of the cycle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vm2gy52v5su61.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=2adc8105c9412a52941d72a2a3d004051504bd9e\n\nIncredibly perceptive and skilled, Hu Tao carefully knows to lull people's fears be it through humor or withholding enough, carefully keeping ordinary folk in the dark. Rightly praised for her wit, she has gleamed enough from Zhongli to guess of his status as adepti or Archon, and is friendly enough with Xiao to be one of the only mortals to have gained his trust.\n\n**In truth, Hu Tao is far more conscious of her image than she lets on.** Normally quick to dismiss people's fears about death as she quells them, still reveals her anxieties with the Parlor's image (\"*It's a shame \u2014 others see us going out to work at night and just don't understand \u2014 and that's what scares them.*\") and the necessity of cremation to assuage the spirits she serves (\"In such cases, cremation always lets Hu Tao find peace of mind. The more anxious she feels, the stronger the flame.\") Gatekeepers themselves are not free of their own fears.\n\nDespite her antics, she remains wary of overstepping her boundaries with friends and acquaintances. In her misjudgment of Qiqi's wishes, she pampers her endlessly and crosses Baizhu. With hints of her skepticism, we see bits of stubbornness shine through a girl carrying the weight of life, death, and far more knowledge than most mortals can bear. Her apathy towards her Pyro Vision received after her grandfather's passing and disdain for combat despite trained under it questions how much of her practice is done out of obligation, rather than her own beliefs.\n\n*\u201cOrder of duality, impermanence of fate\u2026\"*\n\nLiyue's common people remain Hu Tao's utmost priority, managing the region's funerary affairs, spreading comfort in verse as a poet, and in the right amount of raucous wonder. When you find her at the bridges of Huaguang Stone Forest staring down the cliffs or up at the moonlit skies, what does she truly think of life and death? What does her own wisdom bring her to question \u2013 may fate be rewritten? Is the duty entrusted of her as a Funeral Director one that will leave her with no regrets?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mc40ec5x5su61.png?width=1770&format=png&auto=webp&s=19a45b69d6a22eafb72dc480c9c23f98a40317a1\n\n## HISTORY: Karmic Liyue, the Rite of Homa, funerals at thirteen, and Wangsheng's role\n\nUnderstanding Hu Tao's background means understanding the **Rite of Homa: the practice of cremation pioneered by the founders of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.** In the ancient days of warring gods, their fallen corpses produced evil miasmas, product of ill karma, contained in them the dreams and delusions of passed gods. From the struggles of divinity were the lost lives of common citizens, be it gods they believed in or gods that were never theirs.\n\nThen, a merciful doctor cleansed all that is impure with a ritual of fire. Impurities rose with the flames unto the high heavens, turning despair and misfortune into ashen butterflies, respite from the calamities of this world. With the doctor himself reduced into the shape of a lovely butterfly as they had passed, a more peaceful world has erased most of these rituals. What remains then are the descendants with fire in their hearts, feeling the flicker when faced with darkness.\n\n*\u201cOnly an unbound flame can purity this world.\"*\n\nProdigious and eccentric, Hu Tao's nature has been apparent from birth. Already combing through classics while doing handstands at three, and cutting classes to fall asleep in coffins at age six.\n\nMoving in to the Funeral Parlor at age eight, she began her training, though met with much anxiety from the other undertakers. To their surprise, the then-future director's debut at thirteen was conducted with immaculate precision and objectivity.\n\nThis reverence (and later on, partial skepticism) at life's cycles earned her the favor of the gods at thirteen. Old Hu, the 75th Director and Hu Tao's grandfather, had passed and tasked the thirteen-year-old with his own funeral arrangements who had executed the grand funeral flawlessly to the approval of all the other Parlor workers. After the day had ceded, the young Hu Tao trekked to the border at Wuwang Hill in hopes of seeing her grandfather's spirit before crossing unto the other world forever. Only after days of ceaseless waiting against innumerable spirits did an old ghost urge her to go back: as with every mortal rite she conducts, we are bound to the afterlife. Why bear any regrets? Treading back, she found a Pyro Vision in her once-empty backpack. Carrying strength in no remorse, \"*follow your heart, do what you can*.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/14hd12mb6su61.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1957057ac073a629cad190ee68556413a978610\n\n*\u201cBalance must be maintained, and yet destinies remain variable.\"*\n\n**In the present day**, Hu Tao's influence comes from her ordered work at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, and also her work as an esteemed poet with verse spread all over Liyue.\n\nAs the Director of the Funeral Parlor that had gone through seventy-seven generations, Hu Tao's role is no easy feat. Rumored to have dealings with the Fatui and darker business in Liyue's underworld along with storied histories and rituals, Wangsheng's role and significance can't be understated. Under her careful watch, the business' operations have grown (cheeky marketing tactics aside) with a solid reputation. Hu Tao had also instituted the practice of inviting consultants and lecturers for her undertakers, meeting Zhongli, filling in a sort of grandfatherly-figure gap where Old Hu once was for the girl. Entrusted with the responsibilities of this realm and the next, Wangsheng succeeds not only in their work as psychopomps of Liyue, but also safeguarding the truth of this world. Hu Tao's influence has also influenced people to be less averse to death with \"*ceremonies conducted so tactfully that quite a few superstitious people in Liyue have changed their attitudes towards funerals.*\"\n\nAs an influential poet, Hu Tao writes playful verses in her freetime (and on occasion, with Xingqiu) \u2013 garnering most of her reputation. Her Hilitune (based off of a grim Chinese children's tune) is sung from as far as Qingce Village. We even meet the spirit of Dusky Ming near Wangshu Inn humming it away.\n\nWangsheng's ultimate responsibility is to guard the border between life and death. To this end, Hu Tao reveals she's stricter than others before her, yet discerns the difference between order and fate carefully. Hu Tao is presumed to understand Teyvat's cyclical nature as a whole (as in the Prayers items), daring to reject it herself. **After all, why do the ghosts of mortals still linger? Is mortal will enough to latch onto a world, defiant of its laws, out of sheer will?** It's in the same place that she received her Vision and accepted life's meaning does she hold on to her duty \u2013\u2013 and in this place will she too, pass one day\u2026\n\nThere is nothing special about the border between life and death. It's just that nobody knows about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wadi6s06su61.png?width=1542&format=png&auto=webp&s=11c81bd8d851f3f52506e2a9402ce6d7278dc799\n\n# TRIVIA: Lost poetics and some speculation\n\n* Details about Hu Tao's name:\n   * Hu (\u80e1 surname), hu\u2013 is also present in \u201cbutterfly\u201d (hudie \u8774\u8776)\n   * Tao (\u6843) means peach/long life, \u201cthe way of nature and/or the way in which to one\u2019s life\u201d. In China, peaches are symbolically associated with immortality and long life.\n* Her constellation, *Papilio Charontis* is a reference to butterflies, likely the extinct brush-footed [*Jupitellia charon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodryas) and Greek mythology's [*Charon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon), ferrymen that carried souls of the newly-deceased across the river Styx which runs through the border of the living and the dead. The [Ferrylady](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ferrylady) Parlor Worker cements this connection further, as the Charon was the ferryman of the dead.\n* In Chinese, Hu Tao's [constellations read as a poem](https://twitter.com/AngelwingsArt_/status/1376094206024806402) discussing how butterflies guide people towards the afterlife. It references equinox flowers (present in her coat), burnt into incense to turn into threads for the butterflies of the underworld, even directly using her banner name, *'Moment of Bloom*'.\n   * [See one of the earliest interpretations of Hu Tao's lore from her constellations, a flower who loved a butterfly.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VvwmczRzTtsqp721V-S6Aj2iFLlQzFsjiaLO3Rhapd8/edit)\n* In Chinese, [her 'About Ningguang' Voiceline also reads as a poem](https://twitter.com/AngelwingsArt_/status/1376094906377105413), adjectives used in a more poetic manner\u2013\u2013sooo much better than her English voiceline!\n   * It goes like: *\"Tianquan Ningguang, extremely wealthy / a bright and clever gaze / whose beauty makes the plum and apricot blossoms seem ugly / all-seeing and all-hearing / understanding and doing everything properly\"*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a8qntbn26su61.png?width=1234&format=png&auto=webp&s=e979417468bf175ba53820c698c090012e6b896c\n\n* *\\[THEORY\\]* 'Someone's Poetry' in Lingju Pass (and across the other signboards in Liyue) can potentially be read as Hu Tao's: it's careful in praising life's divine cycle, close to Hu Tao's personal ideals. In the game so far, this is one of the only mentors of a **Creator** (related to the Creator, Sustainer \\[of Heavenly Principles\\], and Destroyer in Hinduism; this triad is prominent all over the game).*\"There is a divine order to the world, for every mortal the end must come. Noble or evil, rich or poor, the creator shows favor to none. The cycle of life and death transcends in a boundless universe beyond. Thus we exalt the divine, and praise this rule with song.\"*\n* *\\[THEORY\\]* Hu Tao's Constellation 6, *Butterfly's Embrace,* lets her cheat death. Her Character Demo lines also seem to question life's duality (\"order of duality, impermanence of fate\u2026\") as her Vision story does. Similarly, she questions the unity between yin and yang present in Chongyun (\"*Positive energies and unity between yin and yang... Who knew such people existed in this world*.\"), another sign of confusion at what is supposed to be set order. **For someone fearful of the end yet forceful in guarding the border, what could it mean when her skills let her reject the cycle? When she's constantly hesitant? When she wonders if any of the past Directors have managed the same?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince this is getting a ton of attention (\"Hu Tao's entire character is about he respecting death, this doesn't make sense!\") \u2013 \\[drawing on this relevant discussion thread\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin\\_Impact/comments/mwde7s/hu\\_taos\\_true\\_character\\_an\\_analysis\\_beyond\\_pranks/gvmusef/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/mwde7s/hu_taos_true_character_an_analysis_beyond_pranks/gvmusef/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) to address some points. Remember that **humans live under the dominion of divinity, wherein a higher order impedes on the cycle of life and death.** The gods literally cursed Dainsleif with immortality, are (presumed) to punish/watch over those close to enlightenment (Gnosticism, hello!), and have used their omnipotence and omnipresence to intervene with the natural order, giving Visions to people in life-death scenarios (Qiqi, Bennett) at desperate moments. **Teyvat does not abide by the same natural order as our human world does, because divinity infringes and imposes power over mortals.** Until the higher order of Cyclical Teyvat (hinted at in the Prayers circlets) and divinity truly departs, *there is no natural order*. \n\nThis healthy skepticism is what makes Hu Tao's questioning interesting: life leads unto death, death unto new life... but is that the case in today's Teyvat?  This entire game is about rebellion, defiance of will and fate. As the Rite of Homa entrusted in mortal men the role of purification against evil gods, we reach a state where Hu Tao's literal ex-Archon Consultant is set for a 'contract to end all contracts'. Tradition must be upheld and revered. Death must be respected. So how can we respect death in a false world? \n\nUntil the natural, true cycle of life and death come into Teyvat's higher order and truth, these little hints of Hu Tao's anxieties and defiance stand. For now, we war with gods and question their ways. It is to this end that the rejection of death means the *rejection of the cycles*. \n\nOf course, this could be an overreading into a character who hints at Genshin's themes of human will surpassing divinity and you could enjoy her as the surface level character who loves death and is carefree for it. If you choose to read into these hints and perceive a woman who deals with the adepti, carries history's burdens, and holds an esteemed role in a time where natural order is being questioned, however...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope you enjoyed reading! :) If you want even more on Hu Tao, might I direct you to the 10,000 word monster on my profile?",

        "Title": "[DC Comics] Secret Origins of the Hawk-Snarl: One of the most screwed up continuities in comics.",
        "Body/Content": "To hop on the bandwagon of the many DC Comics related posts lately, I think it\u2019s time to introduce the readers here to the story of Hawkman. If you\u2019re a fan of DC comics related media, you\u2019ve probably encountered a Hawk Person of some kind in a cartoon or TV show, the most famous incarnation probably being the Hawkgirl from Bruce Timm\u2019s Justice League cartoon. What you might not know is that due to a series of oversights and missteps over the years, the Hawks have one of the most confusing backstories in all of comics. \n\nSo strap in everyone, because this one is going to be a trip.\n\n# The Early Days\n\n[Hawkman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkman) was first created in 1940 by Gardner Fox during the Golden Age of Comics. [He was Carter Hall](https://townsquare.media/site/622/files/2016/10/Golden-Age-Hawkman.jpg?w=750&h=1031&q=75), an archaeologist, who found an ancient dagger and discovered that he was the reincarnation of the ancient Egyptian prince Khufu. He created a suit made out of a mysterious Nth metal, which gave him a pretty standard superpower suite of flight, moderate super strength, and durability, with the added flavor of beating people up with archaic weaponry.  He also fought alongside the reincarnation of Khufu's wife Chay-Ara/Shiera, aka Hawkgirl/Hawkwoman. \n\nThe character notably became one of the most prominent founding members of the Justice Society of America (one of the first big superhero teams in comics), becoming its chairman and holding the position until the end of the JSA's run in All Star Comics in 1951. He was the only member of the JSA to appear in every adventure during the Golden Age of Comic Books, which would eventually make him a very important character in the wider DCU. Like most Golden Age superheroes, his series was eventually cancelled in the early 50s and Carter faded into obscurity. \n\nAbout a decade later the Silver Age of comics is underway and DC was taking a lot of its Golden Age characters and reimaging them with new powers, origins, suits and names. Often these reimaginings had a more science-fiction bend to them, so for example Green Lantern went from a guy who found a magic ring and lantern to a guy who is recruited by an alien ring weapon into an intergalactic police force. [Hawkman](https://images-cdn.auctionmobility.com/is3/auctionmobility-static/OYgV-1-2MD0U/1-5EDNT/261-1.jpg?maxwidth=1000&maxheight=1000) was one of the character who got reimagined like this. Now he and Hawkgirl were Katar and Shayera Hol, alien cops from the planet Thanagar who came to Earth in pursuit of an escaped criminal. They had wings made of Nth metal, relatively similar powers, and secret identities working at a museum as Carter and Shiera Hall. Because Katar was a cop, [he was also eventually chosen as a conservative foil](https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Green-Arrow-Hawkman-argument.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=634&dpr=1.5)for Green Arrow after Arrow became a lefty. \n\nAt this point, there\u2019s nothing really distinguishing Hawkman from the many other characters who got rebooted in the Silver Age, which if you are curious is pretty much everyone not named Superman, Batman, Robin, or Wonder Woman. Like many continuity issues in DC, the problem started with the Flash. In the famous \u201cFlash of Two Worlds\" story, it was established that all the old DC characters from the Golden Age still existed on another world called Earth-Two. This meant that there were two completely different versions of Hawkman on two different worlds. Somewhat more complicated, but no different than any other character in the DCU at this point.  \n\n# Hawk Snarl Begins\n\nThen came the Crisis on Infinite Earths in 1985. I won\u2019t give you the gory details of the actual event for the sake of brevity, but just know that it ended with all the various alternate universes being merged into a single universe. The intent was to clean up the convoluted continuity that had built up over the years, but in the case of Hawkman it made things infinitely more complicated. Now there are two Hawkmen on the same Earth: the alien cop and the archaeologist. The alien and his wife were briefly members of a rebooted Justice League, while the Golden Age characters were temporarily trapped in Limbo along with the rest of the JSA because no one at DC had any idea what to do with all these WWII Era characters that just got dumped onto the \u201cmain\u201d Earth. \n\nThen [Hawkworld](https://townsquare.media/site/622/files/2016/10/Hawkworld.jpg?w=826&h=1280&q=75) happened.  This 1989 miniseries involved Katar Hol, lawman of Thanagar, being partnered with Shayera Thal II. Now, there\u2019s no real problem with this in theory, since at the time there were a lot of \u201cYear One\u201d type comics coming out giving updated origin stories for various DC characters and teams. This could have just been Katar\u2019s. Unfortunately for Hawkman, someone at DC got their wires crossed and decided to turn Hawkworld into an ongoing series because of its popularity. Now Hawkworld took place in the present day and had Katar and Shayera come to Earth in pursuit of an escaped criminal. \n\nThis, as you can imagine, is the point where things really goes off the rails. To fully beak this down:  Hawkworld was not a retelling of the origin, but a completely new one about a new Hawkman named Katar Hol and a new Hawkgirl named Shayera Thal coming to Earth. However, there\u2019s still another Hawkman named Katar Hol and Hawkgirl named Shayera Hol who\u2019ve been operating as heroes on Earth for years at this point, meaning that there are now two Katars and two Shayeras both operating on Earth. And also Carter and Shiera are still around doing their own thing.\n\nGot all that? I hope you do because it\u2019s about to get worse. To try and fix all of this DC revealed that the Hawkman that joined the Justice League was actually the spy Fel Andar from Thanagar who took the false identity of Carter Hall Jr., the son of the Golden Age Hawkman, and brainwashed his girlfriend Sharon Parker to make her believe that she was Shayera. He would then kill her when she learned the truth, because what\u2019s superhero comic drama without a few dead girlfriends/spouses? Oh, and I almost forgot that Hector Hall, the actual son of the Golden Age Hawkman, was still alive post-Crisis and would go on to become very important.\n\nSo that\u2019s six Hawkpersons flying around swinging their maces. How to fix this nonsense? If you know DC, you know the answer: another Crisis. This one was called Zero Hour and it was meant to serve as a patch for all the things that the last Crisis didn\u2019t fix and/or made worse. On the Hawk side of things it was revealed that Katar's father had landed on Earth at some point and met Carter Hall, and based Thanagar's wings on Carter's and named his son (Katar) after Carter; it was also revealed that Katar was half-human. All the disparate Hawkmen and Hawkwomen were fused into a single being, a \"Hawkgod\" ([yes, you read that right](https://townsquare.media/site/622/files/2016/10/Hawkgod.jpg?w=1200&h=1262&q=75)). The end result was that Carter, Katar and Shiera did not exist anymore, Fel Andar became a character of his own and Shayera went back to Thanagar.\n\nNow did this fix things? No, it did not. Even with the above retcon the character\u2019s backstory was so convoluted that it DC editorial decided he was completely unusable and to declared the character entirely off-limits. This was the (in)famous \u201cHawk Embargo\u201d and it lasted into the late 90s. Among other things, it\u2019s the reason why famous writer and chaos mage Grant Morison\u2019s run on Justice League has [Zauriel](https://townsquare.media/site/622/files/2016/10/Zauriel.jpg?w=725&h=635&q=75), a winged angelic hero who uses archaic weaponry, instead of any of the Hawks. While Zauriel was originally pitched as Morison\u2019s own version of Hawkman, editorial vetoed them. \n\n# Sanity Strikes Back\n\nIn the late 1990s writers James Robinson, Geoff Johns and David Goyer revived the Justice Society in the series JSA. Now if you\u2019ll recall, the Hawks are pretty important characters to the JSA historically, and because of that the writers felt they needed to be included in some way.  So they established that Shiera's soul escaped from the Hawkgod and reincarnated in Kendra Saunders, the new Hawkgirl, who had no memory of her previous lives, which also allowed them to ignore all the above mentioned nonsense. Geoff Johns brought back the Golden Age Hawkman (Carter Hall) and merged the Golden and Silver Age origin stories: a ship from Thanagar crashed in ancient Egypt, and Prince Khufu and his wife Chay-Ara got access to their tech and the Nth metal. They were killed by the priest Hath-Set and reincarnated several times. Also, since Carter Hall absorbed Katar Hol's memories while they were the Hawkgod, you can just consider Katar an unofficial reincarnation. \n\nSo things (kind of) make sense now and the Hawks return to their rightful place as solid B-listers in DC\u2019s roster and regular members of various hero teams. At around this time we also get the famous Bruce Timm/Paul Dini Justice League cartoon, which used a version of the Silver Age Hawkgirl as one of the core cast members. Thanks to some good writing and creative liberties on the show\u2019s part, the character of Hawkgirl wound up becoming significantly more popular, arguably eclipsing the popularity of Hawkman himself.  \n\nBack in the comics, there was a bit of a hiccup where Grant Morrison killed off the Hawks in their big crossover Final Crisis (it wasn\u2019t final), even though Geoff Johns wanted to use them for his big crossover Blackest Night (so he could kill them). Johns got his way, as he often did at this time, so they were brought back to life at the last minute, killed in Johns\u2019 event comic, and turned into zombies because that was kind of Blackest Night\u2019s thing. At the conclusion of this event, the pair were revived again, except Kendra turned completely into Shiera (remember her?). Then they became wind elementals or something. It doesn\u2019t really matter because another continuity reboot is coming, which means that the Hawk continuity is about to get completely screwed up yet again. \n\n# Revenge of the Snarl\n\nSo in 2011, DC gets the bright idea to completely reboot its universe. This was known as the New 52 and while it was advertised as a \u201cclean slate\u201d for the DCU, in practice it was so haphazardly handled that most of the people writing for DC had no idea what was in continuity and what wasn\u2019t. [When Hawkman was reintroduced in the New 52](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSavage-Hawkman-Vol-Darkness-Rising%2Fdp%2F1401237061&psig=AOvVaw3mwRVsQU_OyvBiD8lV9-ij&ust=1631201079623000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCLDb7NvX7_ICFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD), it was a version of the Carter Hall character trying to retire for some vague reason. In addition to the usual mace and wings, he also had shards of Nth metal fused into his body after a while that gave him additional powers. Meanwhile, Kendra was rebooted onto the new alternate universe Earth-2 (where they put modernized versions of JSA characters) as a completely unrelated character who went by Hawkgirl but was otherwise unrelated to the main universe's Hawkman mythos.\n\nThen, as if poor Hawkman hadn\u2019t suffered enough, [they brought Rob Liefeld on to write him](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hipcomic.com%2Flisting%2Fsavage-hawkman-10-rob-liefeld-joe-bennett-nm%2F6184447&psig=AOvVaw14TzDb10zk43VxgM7q4CKP&ust=1631201132733000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCKCDxffX7_ICFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD). For those unaware, Liefeld is arguably the poster boy of what has been dubbed the \u201cDark Age\u201d of comics. He\u2019s famous for helping to codify the concept of the 90\u2019s Antihero with characters like Cable and for his [unique](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50006/1000115285/original/honorable-mention-photo-u1?auto=format&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&w=650&q=60&dpr=1) [interpretations](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50068/1001347995/original/what-goes-where-photo-u1?auto=format&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&w=650&q=60&dpr=1) [of](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50068/1001347992/original/no-one-has-ever-once-sat-that-way-photo-u1?auto=format&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&w=650&q=60&dpr=1) [human](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50006/1000116345/original/big-guns-photo-u1?auto=format&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&w=650&q=60&dpr=1) [anatomy](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50006/1000115278/original/thighs-photo-u1?q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=1&w=60). This made him one of the more infamous and ridiculed people in the industry well before he was tapped for Hawkman, so what DC was thinking here I will never know. \n\nFor whatever reason, Liefeld decided to retcon Hawkman's origin story in a #0 issue, revealing that \"Carter Hall\" was actually Katar Hol from Thanagar and had amnesia; Carter Hall was just a cover identity he adopted when he landed on Earth. Also, Carter Hall apparently existed as someone whose identity Katar had stolen and Katar had an intimate knowledge of earth archaeology despite being an alien with amnesia. Shayera was reintroduced and then re-killed, Katar joined two different Justice Leagues, and then finally died in the [Death of Hawkman](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fimages-na.ssl-images-amazon.com%2Fimages%2FI%2FA1wms2ptM4L.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FDeath-Hawkman-Marc-Andreyko%2Fdp%2F1401268242&tbnid=Vu3XcXsIHlrlzM&vet=12ahUKEwj00cLL2e_yAhU9nnIEHe1iDW4QMygAegUIARCnAQ..i&docid=SL9V7Jr-ue8_QM&w=1647&h=2560&q=death%20of%20hawkman&hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwj00cLL2e_yAhU9nnIEHe1iDW4QMygAegUIARCnAQ) miniseries... his last words being \"see you in the next life\", even though the whole reincarnation thing had never been established with this character. \n\nAnd then another event comic, Dark Nights: Metal, revealed that the the real Carter Hall Hawkman did in fact exist in whatever continuity we\u2019re in at this point (the whole New 52 thing had mostly been dropped at this point) alongside a Shiera Hawkgirl. Once again, Prince Khufu and Princess Chay-Ara found a crashed spaceship made of Nth Metal and operated as Hawkman and Hawkgirl throughout their numerous lives. One of those lives happened to reincarnate Khufu as Carter and Chay-Ara as Shiera. Both operated as Hawkman and Hawkgirl as usual and died at some point in the past. Both were reincarnated again, this time Shiera coming back as Kendra Saunders \u2014 this time recalling her previous lives \u2014 both once again operating as Hawkman and Hawkgirl. Carter later disappeared into a place called the Dark Multiverse while Kendra took up the identity of Lady Blackhawk. This helps explain why Katar was able to pass himself off as Carter, but didn\u2019t explain why Kendra would allow this and not get involved. The most likely answer to this being \u201cwe want to forget all that Liefeld stuff ever happened\u201d.\n\n[A 2018 Hawkman series](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/cmx-images-prod/Item/684257/684257._SX1600_QL80_TTD_.jpg) tried to put this mess to bed for good by revealing that Hawkman didn't just reincarnate through time, but through space as well, meaning he was both Carter Hall and Katar Hol at one point or another. While there are still some questions and continuity hiccups, like how exactly there could have been a Hawkman reincarnation on Krypton when Superman was a baby, this seems to have resolved the issue for now.\n\nSo that\u2019s the story of Hawkman, the character with the most confusing backstory in all of comics. It\u2019s all kind of a sad waste. The guy has a good design and a pretty cool concept with the whole reincarnation thing, but his continuity troubles have overshadowed that until very recently. He\u2019s basically the living embodiment of how poor communication and planning behind the scenes can completely derail a character. Unfortunately, he\u2019s far from the only example but those are stories for another time. \n\nSpecial shout out to [this TV Tropes page](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ContinuitySnarl/Hawkman) and Wikipedia for cataloging most of this nonsense. Hopefully I got everything, but can you really blame me if I didn't?",

        "Title": "I went through and wrote down who every team had the opportunity to draft since 2003. Wolves fans beware.",
        "Body/Content": "**The Idea**\n\n\nMy buddy and I were talking about how the Wolves passed up Steph Curry twice in the 2009 draft (they drafted Rubio at 5, Jonny Flynn at 6 with Steph going at 7) and how much different the Wolves would look right now. So I thought, I wonder what other teams could have had.\n\n**The Rules**\n\n*The player the team \u201cshould have\u201d drafted has to be taken five spots or less later than they could\u2019ve drafted him. This ensures the scouting opinion is consistent with the league. For example, the Wolves would much rather have Jimmy Butler (No. 30 pick in 2011 draft) than Derrick Williams (No. 2 pick in 2011), but the entire league had the opportunity to pick Butler and whiffed. So it wasn\u2019t a case of ineptitude by the Wolves not drafting Butler, he\u2019s just an outlier the whole league missed on.\n\n*This isn\u2019t a world in which the players just go to one team. Example: The Pistons drafted Chase Budinger at No. 44 in 2009 and the Wolves (I\u2019m sorry Minnesota!) drafted Nick Calathes at No. 45. The Cavs drafted Danny Green at No. 46. In my hypothetical team building, I would give Green to both the Pistons and the Wolves, since they both had the chance to draft him. Each team exists in their own little draft universe (insert \u201ctime is a flat circle\u201d meme).\n\n*I\u2019m starting with the legendary 2003 draft class because that\u2019s just when I started following the NBA at a serious level.\n\n*I\u2019m just doing the first round.\n\n*If a scrub was drafted, followed by five scrubs, I just ignored it. Or if everybody is retired.\n\n*I\u2019m not redoing the 2015 draft, because I don\u2019t think rookies can be judged with less than a full season of experience. Just a personal belief.\n\n**Keep in mind**\n\nI know, I know. If player X went to crappy situation Y, then player X wouldn\u2019t have developed into a good player. Each player needs the right situation to prosper. I know that. This is just meant to be a fun \u201cooohhh look what we could have had!\u201d type of post. Please don\u2019t take it too seriously and be *too* mean to me.\n\nOk, let\u2019s get started. The player in parentheses is the player the team actually drafted. The number next to each player is his draft order. Bolded names are players the teams actually drafted that I couldn\u2019t find a better replacement for. I\u2019m starting the Wolves, because, well\u2026.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Minnesota Timberwolves**\n\nPG \u2014 Steph Curry 7 (Ricky Rubio 5)\n\nSG \u2014 C.J. McCollum 10 (Trey Burke 9) or J.J.

What I tried to do was say each team had the chance to draft some player, but they didn't. So the Celtics came away with Kelly Olynyk, the 13th pick in the draft (via trade from Dallas) so they technically didn't draft him, but they still came away with the 13th pick in the draft and they *could* have had something else. Hope that reasoning makes sense.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nedit 3: added Spurs and Thunder & correct Eric Maynor. He was not the No. 2 pick in the draft.",

        "Body/Content": "It's difficult being a parent. Your job is to raise protect your child(ren) and do your best to raise them the right way. However, the outside world is hard to avoid, and it will always come with its hardships. For one family, no matter how much they tried to love their daughter and give her a promising upbringing, something or someone took her away from them. This is the unresolved disappearance of Asha Degree.\n\n[Harold and Iquilla Degree](https://imgur.com/a/KWVEHuh) got married on Valentines Day in 1988. One year later they became parents to O\u2019Bryant Degree, and on August 5, 1990, they had their second child, Asha Jaquilla Degree. The young family lived in Shelby, North Carolina, on 3404 Oakcrest Drive, and were very close-knit, with Harold\u2019s mother and sister living down the street from them.\n\nGrowing up, the Degree family were very religious and attended Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church every week without fail. Asha thoroughly enjoyed church and was always eager to go to her weekly Bible study. Seeing how the family was Christian oriented, Harold and Iquilla did their best to shelter their children from the deviances of the outside world, with limited television and no access to a computer, saying, *\u201cEvery time you turned on the TV there was some pedophile who had lured somebody\u2019s child away.\u201d*\n\nAt the age of nine-years-old, Asha was coming into her own person. She was a fourth-grade student at Fallston Elementary and was described as an outstanding student with an exceptional attendance record. When it came to education, she had a knack for science and mathematics. She also enjoyed reading and writing -- even having ambitions to become an illustrator, and her English class had just finished reading the book [\u201cThe Whipping Boy\u201d by Sid Fleischman](https://imgur.com/a/1Co7WOH) - a children\u2019s book about two kids running away from home but eventually return.\n\nAside from excelling in her education, Asha also loved sports -- particularly basketball, where she was the [star point guard](https://imgur.com/a/2bPcOIb) on her pee-wee team, the Fallston Bulldogs. Asha\u2019s brother was also heavily involved in sports and was on the boys\u2019 basketball team. \n\nDue to Asha and O\u2019Bryant\u2019s upbringing, they were more responsible than your average child. They would often let themselves in their own home after school and would be found doing their homework or chores by the time their mother arrived home from her job at Kawai America Manufacturing, while their father would get home late from PPG Industries, where he worked the second shift as a dock loader. \n\nOn Friday, February 11, 2000, all schools were closed for a three day weekend because of Presidents Day. The next day on Saturday, Asha\u2019s school held their first basketball game of the season. Unfortunately, Asha fouled out and her team lost the game. The loss had her visibly distraught because she felt as if she let her teammates down. Nevertheless, as many children do, she quickly recuperated and was back to her normal self. \n\nThe following morning things were seemingly normal as the Degree family went to church. Once the services concluded, they all went to [aunt] Alisha\u2019s residence and their grandmother prepared lunch for the family. After spending the afternoon together, Asha and her parents went home because Harold had to get ready for work.\n\nAt approximately 8:00 p.m., Asha and her brother -- who shared the same bedroom -- went to bed early because they stayed up late the night before because they had a sleepover with their cousins, and they had school the next day. An hour later, she awoke due to a blistering thunderstorm, and a power outage occurred in the neighborhood after someone had a car accident in the vicinity. \n\nHarold arrived home at 12:30 a.m. and the power restored shortly thereafter. Upon his arrival, he checked on the children and they were sound asleep in their beds (there are some sources that state Asha was still up and in the living room at the time). Harold decided to relax for a couple of hours and checked on his kids once more before going to bed at 2:30 a.m. (I have seen some people say Harold left home between that two hour period to get Valentines Day candy, but I haven\u2019t been able to substantiate that claim). Not too long later, O\u2019Bryant woke up to the sound of Asha getting out of bed to use the restroom. Moments later, he heard her bed squeak. Thinking that she had crawled back to bed, he paid her no mind and went back to sleep. \n\n**This is where things become mysterious.** \n\nIquilla awakened at 5:45 a.m. and got the bath ready for the kids since they didn\u2019t take one the night before. At 6:30 a.m. she went to wake up Asha and O\u2019Bryant. When she went to their room she noticed O\u2019Bryant was sound asleep but Asha wasn\u2019t in her bed. She thought this was peculiar but wasn\u2019t entirely worried, as she scoured the rest of the home expecting to find her. Panic began to seep in, and she went outside to check their two vehicles hoping to find her but to no avail. She proceeded to wake up Harold, who advised her to call his mother to see if Asha was there, but she hadn\u2019t been. Iquilla then called her own mother, and with no luck, [Harold phoned the police](http://www.webbsleuths.com/cgi-bin/dcf/dcboard.cgi?az=printer_format&om=249&forum=MC). \n\nThe police arrived ten minutes later at 6:40 a.m. Search dogs were brought in but they were unable to pick up a scent on Asha -- possibly due to the thunderstorm. Nonetheless, Asha\u2019s family and the police searched the local neighborhood but no trace of her could be found. By noon, over sixty people, including residents in the area, the church congregation, and a helicopter with infrared heat-detection were aware of what was transpiring and went to assist in the search. Despite an all afternoon pursuit of nearby woods and fields, nothing was found beside a mitten that didn\u2019t belong to Asha or her family. \n\nWhen Asha\u2019s family examined her bedroom for clues they found that her backpack was missing, which she kept her house key in, along with her Tweety Bird purse, and an assortment of clothing. Moreover, all of the doors and windows in the home had been locked -- indicating Asha left on her own volition. This revelation suggested that the squeaking O\u2019Bryant heard wasn\u2019t Asha crawling back into bed. Instead, she was packing her book bag and was getting ready to leave home, for reasons unknown.\n\nAsha\u2019s disappearance was [broadcasting on the local news that evening](https://imgur.com/a/1C7Kfoj). This coverage prompted several witnesses to come forward. According to three different people, they said they had seen Asha walking alongside N.C. Highway 18 between 3:45 - 4:15 a.m., only one block away from her residence. One driver was very concerned for her well being because it was still storming outside, and she didn\u2019t have any winter clothing on, so he made a U-Turn to see if she needed any help. When he attempted to check on her she darted off into the nearby woods and was never seen again.\n\nWith new leads to work on, the police searched heavily into the woods where a witness said she ran off into, and that\u2019s when they uncovered a shed of a nearby business, Turner Upholstery, and discovered that Asha presumably sheltered herself from the storm because candy wrappers were littered about, a pencil and marker were found, and a Mickey Mouse shaped hair-bow was also located. Asha\u2019s family confirmed to the police that those items did indeed belong to their missing daughter. \n\nThe month of March was hectic for the Degree family. In order to spread more awareness to the public, they began selling t-shirts with Asha\u2019s picture on the front, but this quickly came to a halt once they discovered someone was trying to pocket the money made in this charitable cause. With the money they did raise they offered $5,000.00 for a reward for any information leading to Asha\u2019s whereabouts. Her case also made headlines across national television programs including The Montel Williams Show, America\u2019s Most Wanted, and The Oprah Winfrey Show. Aside from this, her case hasn\u2019t been featured in the spotlight other than local news stations from time to time.\n\nSubsequently, Asha\u2019s family members underwent polygraph testing -- a procedure that is routine in a missing person(s) case -- and passed with flying colors. Additionally, the lead investigators in the case traveled to Quantico, Virginia to have a profile created of a possible suspect, if this was indeed a case of an abduction, yet the profile was unable to locate any prominent suspects.\n\nAsha\u2019s case was being actively investigated, but her case was turning cold as all leads being phoned in were turning up no results. It wasn\u2019t until August 3, 2001, when twenty-six miles away in Burke County -- the opposite direction of where Asha was seen walking -- a contractor working a construction project unearthed a [backpack that was wrapped in two black plastic trash bags and buried](https://imgur.com/a/t4V8FDo). It was confirmed to be Asha\u2018s because it had her name and phone number printed on it.\n\nWith the latest lead in the case, the police thoroughly examined the construction site and discovered a pair of men\u2019s khaki pants and skeletal remains that belonged to an animal. The findings were sent to an FBI crime laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, but the results and additional details have never been made public. Despite the latest bombshell discovery, Asha\u2019s case wasn\u2019t producing any promising information and her case went cold, though the police did announce they believe Asha left her residence on her own free will and met with foul play.\n\nThirteen years later in January 2014, lead detectives in Asha\u2019s case hoped to catch a break when U.S. Marshals arrested [52-year-old Donald Preston Ferguson](https://imgur.com/a/WuM49tq) at his residence in Spartanburg, South Carolina for the 1990 murder of [7-year-old Shalonda Poole](https://imgur.com/a/J9iCB8d), who was found strangled, stabbed, and sexually assaulted behind a Greensboro, North Carolina Elementary School. \n\nAt the time of Shalonda\u2019s murder, Donald Ferguson was arrested in June 1989 for sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl in Spartanburg, South Carolina. He managed to place bail while awaiting trial and relocated to Greensboro, North Carolina, where he eventually met Shalonda Poole through her half-brother, Marvin Cowan. Shortly after her body was found, he moved back to South Carolina. When he finally went to trial in March 1991, he was found guilty and sentenced to eight years in prison, but was released in October 1997.\n\nInitially, Melvin Bennett, a mentally disabled individual who had an IQ of less than 70 and was a co-worker of Shalonda\u2019s mother at the University of North Carolina of Greensboro confessed to her murder. He would be indicted for first-degree kidnapping and first-degree statutory sexual offense by a Guilford County grand jury in March 1991, but six months later DNA tests proved he was innocent. After a four day trial in October 1992, he was officially found not guilty.\n\nShalonda Poole\u2019s case went cold until her case was re-opened in 2007. Through advancements in forensics, the police were led to Donald Ferguson, when DNA was collected from an entirely different sexual assault case that was being examined in 2013, and it surprisingly matched to the DNA evidence obtained from Shalonda Poole\u2019s case. Once he was apprehended, the Cleveland County police focused in on him after looking at his past history and noticing Shalonda\u2019s case bore similarities to Asha\u2019s disappearance.\n\nShalonda shared a room with her twin sister, and mysteriously vanished in the early morning hours of July 21, 1990, between 6:00 - 8:00 a.m. When she was reported missing many people helped search for her including Donald Ferguson. He had known Shalonda\u2019s family for about a month and had even been to her home days beforehand playing cards with her family. Her body was uncovered one day later, bound and gagged. She suffered 19 stab wounds to the neck and was manually strangled. \n\nAfter a thorough investigation into Donald Ferguson in a possible connection to Asha Degree\u2019s disappearance, he is considered to not have any involvement in her case. In December 2014, he pleaded guilty to Shalonda\u2019s murder and was convicted of first-degree murder and first-degree sexual assault and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. \n\nIn February 2015, the Cleveland County Sheriff\u2019s Office and FBI began to reexamine Asha\u2019s case, going through all the evidence collected and re-interviewing people from the initial investigation. During this strenuous process, a viable new lead was made relevant in May 2016. Law enforcement announced to the public that there may have been sightings of Asha entering a [dark green early 1970s Lincoln Continental Mark IV](https://imgur.com/a/JTDmxeP) or [Ford Thunderbird with rust along the wheel wells](https://imgur.com/a/rTEVj6o). \n\nThree years later in October 2018, the Cleveland County Sheriff\u2019s Office unveiled more possible clues related to Asha Degree\u2019s case via Facebook and asked for the public\u2019s assistance. The first piece of evidence was the book [\u201cMcElligot\u2019s Pool\u201d by Dr. Seuss](https://imgur.com/a/SK7wV0A). It had apparently been checked out at the Fallston Elementary School library around the time of Asha\u2019s disappearance, but the school didn\u2019t contain any records dating that far back.\n\nThe second clue was a white t-shirt with a red collar and matching sleeves featuring a picture of the band \u201cThe New Kids on the Block\u201d on the front. The police are hoping that by releasing this new information they will be able to jog someone\u2019s memory as to whether or not they remember someone having these items shortly before Asha vanished. As of today, there are no prominent suspects in the case despite the latest information released in the last three years. \n\nThroughout all of these years, the small town of Shelby, North Carolina still has missing pictures of Asha plastered all throughout the area, and blue ribbons are tied around tree and light posts -- representing that her case has not been forgotten. They continue to rally behind the Degree family, and despite an awful tragedy, they stay strong as a community, always going out of their way to help a neighbor or friend in need. \n\nAs for the Degree family, they have done everything they possibly can to keep Asha's case shining brightly in the media and in their community. They created a scholarship in Asha's name after watching their son, O'Bryant graduate high school. To raise money for this award for a local student they sell t-shirts with Asha's picture on it and other charitable events. \n\nIn addition, they host an [annual walk, where people gather together at the Degree family home and walk to the location where Asha was last seen -- where a billboard now stands tall with Asha\u2019s photograph](https://imgur.com/a/Kh5xu4w) for everyone to see as they drive on Highway 18. For the better part of thirteen years, they hosted this event on Valentines Day but changed the date to February 7, because Iquilla Degree said it\u2019s not right for people to be sad on a day that should celebrate love.\n\nIt has been a grueling eighteen years for the Degree family. They are plagued by so many questions without any answers. Did she leave on her own accord? If so, why? Did someone lure her away from her home? If so, who? Is she still alive? If so, where is she? Iquilla still holds on to hope that her daughter is still alive and refuses to lose faith. Her conviction in God and the support from her family continue to give her strength to endure another day. Meanwhile, her son, O\u2019Bryant, has a daughter of his own and is almost the same age as Asha was when she disappeared. According to Iquilla, her granddaughter is a spitting image of Asha, and seeing her breathes new life into her, and only motivates her more to find her daughter. As long as the family can remember Asha, though she may be missing, she will always be near in their hearts. \n\n**Sources**\n\n[Asha Degree Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Asha_Degree)\n\n[Asha Degree - The Charley Project](http://charleyproject.org/case/asha-jaquilla-degree)\n\n[JET Magazine Interview](https://www.jetmag.com/news/iquilla-degree-where-is-my-daughter/)\n\n[Donald Ferguson Arrested](https://myfox8.com/2014/01/07/arrest-made-in-1990-rape-murder-of-seven-year-old-shalonda-poole/)\n\n**I also have this write-up on my blog, which you can check out here at:** \n\n[True Crime Articles - The Unresolved Disappearance of Asha Degree](https://truecrimearticles.com/2019/01/01/the-unresolved-disappearance-of-asha-degree/)",

I\u2019ve compiled a list of all the musicals, Broadway concerts, and Broadway documentaries on every streaming service I know of. Every month or so, I plan to update it as the services change their catalogues. Save this post for your own use and link it whenever you see someone asking for recommendations. If you see an error here \u2014 either something is listed that isn\u2019t a musical or I missed a musical \u2014 let me know. Also let me know what\u2019s on any services I didn\u2019t include and I\u2019ll add them to the list.

Incredibly niche, and still doesn\u2019t have much output. Diluc? Universally known as a subpar dps. Dehya? Dehya. Those are all the 5 star claymores, but the 4 stars are mostly damage dealers too, and I think we can all agree that 4 star damage dealers aren\u2019t very meta in general. Xinyan? Razor? Freminet? Beidou? Chongyun? Dori? They have no place in the meta or in higher tiers whatsoever. Sayu is a sub-dps, and she\u2019s mid, and Noelle\u2026well, she\u2019s easily the best claymore support in the game, because she\u2019s the only claymore support in the game. She\u2019s honestly not as bad as the other claymores, but it\u2019s a ridiculously low bar. Now, of course, I am only talking about the meta right now. I love some of these characters; Diluc is my current main, Freminet is going to be another one of my mains for the time being, I used to use Beidou a lot and I find her counterattack mechanic fascinating, Itto sounds really fun to use in general, and I love everything about Kaveh. I don\u2019t deny that these are fun characters that are good characters character-wise, and even though they aren\u2019t meta, it\u2019s still probably possible to clear the abyss with them with enough investment. That being said, there isn\u2019t ONE claymore in the whole game who can even hold a candle to characters like Wanderer or Wriothesley, let alone even stronger dps characters like Ayaka or Hu Tao, let alone absolutely GODLY characters like Neuvillette or Yelan or Furina. All other weapon types have a character that can change one\u2019s account for the better in drastic ways; sword has Furina, Kazuha, Bennett, and Xingqiu. Polearm has Xiangling, Raiden and Zhongli. Catalyst has Nahida, Neuvillette, Sucrose, and Kokomi. Bow has Yelan and Ficshl (idk if I spelled that right). Claymore has no one. At least with geo, you have Zhongli carrying the whole element, and Yunjin being a genuinely good support. Granted, Geo still is in a terrible spot, but nowhere near as abysmal as claymore. I can only hope that Navia will be the saving grace for both Geo and claymore.",
