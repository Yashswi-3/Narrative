We wanted to create an open platform for communities and their members to find and discuss the content they found most interesting. And today, that principle is exactly what net neutrality is all about: preserving an open internet with consumer choice and unimpeded access to information.\n\nNet neutrality ensures that the free market\u2014not big cable\u2014picks the winners and losers. This is a [bipartisan issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/6c2mzt/antinet_neutrality_is_everyones_problem/), and we at Reddit will continue to fight for it. We\u2019ve been here [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2sjkf0/join_us_in_a_final_push_for_net_neutrality_its_as/), and this time we\u2019re facing even worse odds.\n\nBut as we all know, you should never tell redditors the odds.\n\n### A level playing field\n\nNet neutrality gives new ideas, online businesses, and up-and-coming sites\u2014like Reddit was twelve years ago\u2014the opportunity to find an audience and grow on a level playing field. Saving net neutrality is crucial for the future of entrepreneurship in the digital age.\n\nWe weren\u2019t always in the [top ten most-viewed sites in the U.S.](http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US) When Steve and I started Reddit right out of college, we were just two kids with $12K in funding and some computers in Medford, MA. Our plan was to make something people wanted, because we knew if we accomplished that, we could win\u2014even against massive incumbents. \n\nBut we wouldn\u2019t have succeeded if users had to pay extra to visit our website, or if better-funded alternatives loaded faster. Our start-up got to live the American dream thanks to the open internet, and I want to be able to tell aspiring entrepreneurs with a straight face that they can build the next Reddit. If we lose net neutrality, I can\u2019t tell them that.\n\n### We did it, Reddit, and we can do it again.\n\nYou all are capable of creating movements.\n\nI\u2019ve had a front-row seat to witness the power of Reddit communities to rally behind a common goal\u2014starting when you all named a whale [Mister Splashy Pants](https://www.ted.com/talks/alexis_ohanian_how_to_make_a_splash_in_social_media) in 2007. It\u2019s been heartening to watch your collective creativity and energy over the years; it\u2019s easy to take all these amazing moments of community and conversation for granted, but the thing that makes them all possible is the open internet, which unites redditors as an issue above all.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick recap:\n\n* In 2012, [we coordinated with mods to black out the website to protest SOPA & PIPA](https://redditblog.com/2012/01/10/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all-depends/). They called these two bills \u201cinevitable\u201d in DC until America spoke up and they became \u201cunthinkable.\u201d\n* Then, [you all crowdfunded a bus we took through the heartland to support the open internet](http://www.adweek.com/digital/inside-reddits-internet-2012-bus-144244/). \n* Back in 2014, [you all rallied to deluge the FCC with thoughtful comments in support of net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/275mqp/reddit_there_are_only_45000_comments_on_the_fccs/), and [we collected your best comments for our own letter to the FCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2aohmu/reddit_is_filing_an_fcc_comment_to_fight_for_an/). \n* [You crowdfunded $20,000 to put up net neutrality ads across DC](https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/13/5711012/net-neutrality-protest-posters-go-up-across-washington-ahead-of-fcc-vote).\n* In the span of a few hours, [you made over 15,000 phone calls to the FCC and your representatives](https://redditblog.com/2015/01/15/join-us-in-a-final-push-for-net-neutrality-its-as-easy-as-calling-858-wheeler/)!\n\nAnd all of this actually *worked*.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about the U.S., because [redditors in India have used the site to defend net neutrality](https://redditblog.com/podcast/a-neutral-net-part-two/) and the CRTC (the Canadian equivalent of the FCC) [visited r/Canada for a thoughtful (and 99% upvoted!) discussion with citizens](https://np.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/54kz6g/im_from_the_crtc_and_we_want_to_know_what_you/). \n\nReddit is simply too large to ignore, and you all did all of this when we were just a fraction of the size we are today.\n\n### Time to get back to work\n\nWe\u2019re proud to join major internet companies like Amazon, Etsy, Twitter, and Netflix ([better late than never!](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/06/15/netflix-joining-next-months-net-neutrality-protest-says-it-will-never-outgrow-the-fight/)) in today\u2019s Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality, orchestrated by Fight for the Future. We\u2019ve already been hosting AMAs on the subject with politicians (like [Senator Schatz](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6k27ny/im_us_senator_brian_schatz_lead_democrat_on_the/)) and journalists (like [Brian Fung from the Washington Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6lfkwh/im_brian_fung_a_washington_post_reporter_covering/)). Today we\u2019re changing our logo and sharing a special message from Steve, our CEO, with every visitor to our front page to raise awareness and send people to **[BattleForTheNet.com](http://battleforthenet.com)**. Most exciting, [dozens of communities on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) (with millions of subscribers) across party lines and interest areas have joined the cause. If your community hasn\u2019t joined in yet, now\u2019s the time! (And you\u2019ll be in good company: u/Here_Comes_The_King is on our side.)\n\n*The FCC [is deciding this issue the way big cable and ISPs want it to](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/05/18/fcc-votes-to-start-rolling-back-landmark-net-neutrality-rules/?utm_term=.b7242cbf9cd1), so it\u2019s on us as citizens to tell them\u2014and our representatives in the Senate and House\u2014how important the open internet is to our economy, our society, and especially for when we\u2019re bored at work.*\n\nI invite everyone who cares about this across the internet to come talk about it with us on Reddit. Join the conversation, upvote stories about net neutrality\u2019s importance to keep them top of mind, [make a high-quality GIF or two](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/6gnyl4/giffing_for_net_neutrality/), and, most importantly, [contact the FCC](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) to let them know why *you* care about protecting the open internet.\n\nThis is how we win: when every elected official realizes how vital net neutrality is to all of their constituents.\n\n--Alexis\n\n**Comment on this post with why net neutrality is important to you! We\u2019re visiting D.C. next month, so if you're an American, add your representatives' names to your comment, we\u2019ll do our best to share your stories with them on Capitol Hill!**",

The money was routed through call centers in India back to the ringleaders in eight states.\n\n>The fraudulent calls came suddenly and frequently while the scam was active from 2012 to 2016, according to court documents. A person posing as an Internal Revenue Service or immigration official was on the phone, threatening arrest, deportation or other penalties if the victims did not immediately pay their debts with prepaid cards or wire transfers.\n\n>In an announcement on Friday, the department said 21 people living in eight states \u2014 Illinois, Arizona, Florida, California, Alabama, New Jersey and Texas \u2014 were sentenced last week in Houston to prison for up to 20 years for their role in the scheme.\n\n>In addition, 32 contractors in India involving five call centers in Ahmedabad, a city in western India, have been indicted on wire fraud, money laundering and other conspiracy charges as part of the operation, the department said.\n\nAs always, remain vigilant about supposed IRS claims, and never accept or believe any calls from people purporting to be the IRS. The IRS never demands immediate payment (e.g. wire transfers or gift cards), or threatens to bring in the police, immigration officers or other law-enforcement. Communication always begins over snail mail. Hopefully these arrests will serve as a warning to others trying to prey on vulnerable populations. ",

        "Title": "HR tried to Get Rid of my Dad right before he was able to get his pension",
        "Body/Content": "My Father worked for a Forbes 500 company since the 70s.  Moved up the ranks as a software engineer and management, has patents for the company that saved it millions of dollars.  He's almost to pension age and suddenly HR starts making his life miserable.  He noticed this trend was happening to some of his coworkers when they were getting close to age 60 as well.\n\nHR Lady calls him into the office and says that he was not punching in and out at the correct time.    My Father, an engineer, is very very detail oriented.  He knew that these were false accusations and asked HR to prove it.  They came back a week later and couldn't prove it.  And he said,  \"Of course you can't.  I have been driving the corporate carpool bus from \\[A major city 40 miles away from the company\\] for the last 15 years.  I always have 16 witnesses on my clock in time and I haven't been late in 15 years.\"\n\nHR Lady came back a week later and they said that they were going to fire him for letting people into the building without badging.  He asked to see when and where he was letting someone into the building without badging.  They showed that he held the door for his best friend who had also been working there since the 70s who had his foot cut off after having type 2 diabetes. He was in a wheelchair.\n\nPrior to this my dad took the chief of security out for lunch and told him about how this company wanted him to leave before he got his pension so he got some footage of his own.  My dad said, \"That is very interesting.  You are going to fire me for holding the door for my best friend of 35 years after his foot was amputated and he was in a wheelchair?  Fine then I hope you fire the CEO and yourself as well!!!\"  He then proceeded to show footage of the HR lady holding the door for his friend and the CEO holding the door for his friend.\n\nMy Father ended up staying there until he got his pension.\n\nEdit:  I don't know his finances and he probably wouldn't have lost the whole pension but there was a definite financial difference from being fired prior to reaching age 60 and making it to age 60.\n\nEdit 2:  So this blew up so much that my brother who didn't know I was on Reddit texted me and said \"You are reddit famous.  That's a story about Dad!  I knew this was you.\"  Also some of you are wondering why a Software Engineer would have to clock in and out, well he didn't.    I meant to use the word badge in and out of the building, they went that far to talk with security to see his badge timestamps.  There are more things that led to this getting bad and I didn't want to write pages and pages but it definitely escalated to this point.  Lastly for those of you that have been saying that my dad must have worked there as a child, this whole thing happened roughly 9 years ago.  My father is 68 right now.  If you want to know what company it was: this sentence is the most general hint I can give you but it may drive people from that company to be mad at me.  \n\n\nFinal Update:  Dad quit that job a while ago and made his own company in his retirement.  He has used his own money to patent a new invention that desalinates seawater and provides clean solar energy.  He has patents for this in America, India, and China and is looking for some capital to provide clean water and power to 3rd world countries.  If interested in helping him build his first power plant please send me a message.  \n",

        "Body/Content": "With release of Mulan at $30 on Disney+ even if you had a subscription doesn't really bode well for us consumers in future where we have to shell out extra money even after paying for 3-4 subscriptions already on average (Netflix, Disney+, Prime, HBO). Some of the companies in India have already started following Disney's lead and putting new movies out of subscription for $35 to $40 rent. This was really scummy from Disney when they increased the subscription price by 50% here when lockdown started. I wouldn't mind paying a little bit extra as a part of annual subscription to offset for new movies but selling them out of subscription is bad for consumers and with a big company like Disney leading the charge,  most of the local smaller companies will follow.\nHow is it in your respective countries? Have your local language streaming platforms started doing something similar?",
