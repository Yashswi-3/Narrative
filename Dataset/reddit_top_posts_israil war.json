While speaking of that, I also alluded to how reinterpretation of prophetic narratives has occurred in the past. It is in the vein of that that I write regarding two stories in the Biblical tradition that arguably help contextualize Sodom for what it was- a bastion of inhospitality.\n\nTo start off, we should start off with a little background regarding the stories that I will discuss. To start, I will begin with a overview of one of the darkest, and perhaps one of the more tragic stories of the Biblical Canon- an event that has been called the Horror Story of the Judges- the tale of the 19th to 21st chapters of the Book of Judges- that of the Outrage, Horror and Tragedy of Gibeah, the story of the Levite's Concubine, also known as the Benjamite War.\n\n**The Outrage of Gibeah- When Sacrifice Kills**\n\nThe story of Gibeah is one of the judeo-christian tradition, found within the Nevim Chapters of the Torah, in the Book of Judges. The time period this book of the Torah describes was one after Bani Israil made it into Israel, but before the monarchy was established (the kingship of Dawud and his heirs)- instead, Israel was ruled by a council of judges (qadis), which included prophets, soldiers and officials within it's ranks. Famous individuals such as Deborah, who led the israelites in battle against the Cannanites, and Samson, who was blessed with super strength and brought down an entire temple with his own hands, are amongst some of the more famous figures. (Samson's story in particular is a darker mirror to Zuleikha and Yusuf's as seen in sufi understandings in his relationship with Delilah. Unlike Zuleikha, the love Samson had for Delilah does not stop her from continuing to make bad decisions, even leading her to betray him to the philistines- leading to his death at the temple of Dagon.)\n\nA major theme of this era was how the law was often bent or broken by individuals- sometimes for good- but also for evil. One on end, you had hospitality being received and given from and to people considered the enemy in the story of the Book of Ruth. On the other hand, you had horrible oaths made in the name of god, and due to fear of not wanting to break them and have divine wrath thrown upon them and not being aware that they could be broken,  led to affairs such as child sacrifice or life imprisonment (essentially extreme purdah) in the story of Jephthah and his Daughter. It is this latter, more darker tone that Gibeah's tale finds itself in.\n\nMost familiar with this story know of Gibeah as the site of a civil war between several of the tribes of Bani Israil, known as the benjamite war. The war itself is a study of the worst tragedies the children of Israel slipped into during the era of the judges prior to the monarchial era of Talut and later Dawud and his heirs.\n\nIn the story overall however, we see allusions to inhospitality, extreme contempt for others, and lurid violence inflicted upon innocents. Several instances of criminal activity are exhibited in the story, in contrast's to Ruth's hospitable tone- including but not limited to: **Physical assault, hospitality violations, abductions, gang rape, and tribal massacres**.\n\nHowever, most muslims likely do not know what exactly precipitated this entire mess: **The gang rape of a woman, to prevent the gang rape of a man.**\n\n**Part 1- The Path to Looming Tragedy: From Ephraim to Gibeah**\n\nThe story stretches across Judges 19-21 (chapters 19-21) and begins in the lands of the tribe of Ephraim (one of the ten lost tribes of Bani Israil- they were destroyed by invasions from Assyria- and Yunus's hatred and refusal to preach for long to the people of Ninevah was likely due to hatred of Assyria (they had not destroyed the northern tribes in his time, but they were feared through the near east in his day). Here, a levite (from the tribe descended from Levi, son of Yaqub) in the area had a concubine who left his household due to feeling she was being neglected (some say the woman may have been adulterous, but the word used in the text referring to this is \"angry\", not a word regarding lust).\n\nThe concubine had proceeded to return to her father's house in Bethlehem, and the levite travelled there to bring her back to the lands held by the tribe of Ephraim. On the return trip from Bethlehem, the concubine requests that they stay in Jerusalem (Bait-Al-Maqdis), but the Levite refuses, saying Jerusalem was not \"of the Israelites\", intending to rest instead at either Gibeah or Ramah. This is a hint that the Levite was discriminatory in his viewing of the tribes, much like how Sodom discriminated against outsiders, when they attacked the angels who posed as foreigners and cut the road on them.\n\nBy the time the duo make it to Gibeah, sundown had approached and they had made it to the town's open square. However, nobody in the town had offered them a place to stay the night as per hospitality norms of the time. An elderly man who had come to Gibeah from Ephraimite territory offers them both a place to rest, as he was living alongside those of the tribe of Benjamin (those descended from Binyameen, son of Yaqub) in Gibeah.\n\nThe Levite/concubine are given food and drink, alongside a place to rest themselves and their steeds. However, this peace does not last long.\n\n**Part 2: The Horror at the Doorstep and the Dreadful Knockers**\n\nWhile the councubine and levite are resting, suddenly men begin hammering at the door of the elderly man's house, demanding that the levite is sent out so that they may \"know him\".\n\nThis phrase is also used in the biblical accounts regarding the mob of Sodom when they inquire about the angels. Effectively, they were using their numbers to coerce the elderly man to throw the levite out to sexually assault him. The levite had not consented to any of this, so to label this consensual would be inaccurate.\n\nHowever, the mob was not so easily bayed from their demands, and so the elderly man of the house came to a decision based on the following maxim: The rape of a man was abhorrent, but the rape of a woman was...less so- and also potentially, if nothing was done they would all likely die, so somebody was going to have to take the fall. With that in mind, the elderly host attempted to placate the mob by offering the concubine and his own daughter to sate their demands, in order to avoid \"the outrageous thing\" that was raping a man. (mentioned in Judges 19, verse 24 \\[19:24\\])\n\nHowever, the mob continued to not listen, and with that in mind, the levite threw out his concubine (weather this was done out of fear of his own safety or contempt for the woman is not stated, though it may have well been the former), and the mob descended on her, raping her through the night. Note the similarity here between the mob at Sodom and here at Gibeah. Both are using their numbers and verbal threats to get what they want: a non-consensual sexual encounter (effective gang rape). Additionally, much like how the orthodox reading has Lut's daughters be completely silent, so too is the concubine in this particular scene.\n\nWhile the Levite has some bare excuse in that he likely did this out of fear for his own life, Lut not being restricted by the angels in committing this if we assume he did offer up his daughters opens up all sorts of disturbing implications.\n\n**Part 3- The Death on the Highway, and the twelve parcels**\n\nThe concubine did not have it easy after her eviction, being abused and raped all night. At a certain point, she collapsed due to exhaustion at the front of the elderly man's house.\n\nThe following morning, the levite placed her on a donkey and continued his journey home. However, the gang rape had severely harmed her, and the woman died on the journey to the mountains of ephraim.\n\nWhen he came home, the levite dismembered the concubine's corpse into twelve pieces, which he sent to the other tribes of Bani Israil, demanding revenge for the incident. Weather this was out of a desire to save his own life from being accused of allowing for rape, or because he was genuinely guilty over what he did to save his life is not mentioned in the text- it could be either case.\n\nConsidering the horrible treatment that the concubine suffered, should Lut be seen as acceptable in potentially giving up his daughters for the same treatment, as the mainstream view states? Is this truly an example of moral conduct? Can Lut truly be called \"one favored of the worlds\" if he did this and did not repent? And if he saw no need to, what does that say about God?\n\n**Part 4- The Benjamite War and the Oath of Mizpah**\n\nWhen the other tribes of Bani Israil heard of the incident after receiving the parcels, they were outraged and gathered a confederated army of up to 400,000 at Mizpah. This force was sent to the lands of the tribe of Benjamin, where they demanded the perpetrators of the gang rape for their execution. However, the benjamites refused to give up their kinsmen, opting to station 26,000 men to defend Gibeah.\n\nThe battle lasted three days, and on the first two, both sides suffered heavy losses. On the third day, the confederated isrealites went to their synagogues and prayed and fasted, giving offerings to the flame of the temple to God. It is said the ark of the covenant (the tabut) was in the temple of that area, and when when Phinehas, the grandson of Harun (Aaron) went up to it, God spoke from it, assuring them of their victory.\n\nOn the third day, the confederated army managed to trick the benjamites through a pincer formation, defeating them. However, they then proceeded to also kill any person and animal they could get their hands on in the territory, guilty or otherwise, effectively erasing their own moral standing.\u00a0They also laid the blame of the benjamites at gibeah on the entire tribe, swearing to not marry any of their women while at Mizpah (an act that came with grave consequences.). Unfortunately, their fear of not wanting to the break the oath of mizpah out of a belief god would punish them, as well as their fear that leading to the destruction of the tribe of benjamin would deepen their dire straits led to more tragedies (a similar belief that an oath to god needed to be fulfilled at all costs or one risked punishment led to Japtheth's sacrificing or putting his daughter in lifelong purdah).\n\n**Part 5-  The Massacre of Jabesh Gliead, and the Kidnappings of Shiloh**\n\nIn their panic over realizing that they effectively massacred one of their sister tribes, alongside the repercussions of not wanting to marry any women from it unless they wanted god to punish them for oath breaking, and the realization they had to repopulate the tribe of benjamin somehow to prevent it from going extinct, the israelites also proceed to bring ruin upon two other communities in their search for suitable women for said repopulation- Jabesh Gilead and Shiloh.\n\nThe first community (Jabesh Gilead) was made victim due to a technicality regarding their absence at a oath making session at mizpah regarding the \"not taking benjmaite women as wives\". Exactly why Jabesh Gilead was not there at the oath making session is an unknown however, at least from the direct text, discounting midrash (the jewish version of tafsirs (exegesis).\n\nThose of Gilead wound up suffering an effective mass murder involving: The \"striking of the sword\" upon all of Jabesh Gilead's women/children, the death of all the men, and the death of any women who knew a man intimately. The women who were virgins were then taken off and given to the men of the confederate army. It should be noted that this fiasco could have been avoided if they had simply not attempted to massacre the benjamites.\n\nAfter all of this was completed, the army still panicked over not having enough women, and proceeded to start abducting women from the city of Shiloh, who were dancing in the outskirts of their city due to a religious festival of the time, such that they could wed them. They would lie in wait near them and then kidnap them, with their plan to use the possibility of the benjamites ending as a tribe as a way to counter any concerns said women's families may bring up over their kidnapping.\n\nEffectively, the story starts off ominously, becomes rather horrific quickly, and ends...rather dismally. The situation essentially spun itself out of control so badly nobody really achieved anything good.\n\nKeeping all of this in mind, why exactly is the muslim orthodoxy so insistent on giving Lut, a man favored over many as per the quran's word, the role of the elderly man of this story, who offered women up to be raped to avoid male rape, which effectively started this entire train wreck of compounding disaster when the levite decided to put that plan to work out of fear for his own life? More importantly, this story shows how taking the \"alternative\" offer wasn't a good thing. How then can we argue that in the story of Lut it somehow was? The people of Sodom were not there for a consensual encounter- the fact that Lut is grieved for his guests and seeks protection from the folk of the city \n\nWhen considering this story, we should reflect back on the prophets we see in the muslim narrative of Sodom. Both Lut (A) and Ibrahim (A) showcase hospitality to the angels, allowing them into their homes, feeding them, and treating them kindly (and in Lut's case- trying to save them from being assaulted).  It is this hospitable nature that we will discuss in the next reflection- that of the Book of Ruth. Unlike Gibeah, the book of Ruth is a tale of kindness and joy to those who are strangers and even potentially enemies, and how such can reap great rewards for all. It is part of the Ketuvim (writings), which form one of the three sections of the Torah. \n\n**The Book of Ruth- A tale of Stranger's and Unlikely Allies**\n\nThe book of Ruth is also one of the nevim chapters, and is set during the same time period as that of Gibeah (that of the Judges), though not directly connected to each other and in some distance time wise. What makes this story so unique however, is how the story showcases a lack of enmity...even when there probably should have been. While most muslims are not familiar with Ruth, she is important within genealogies of the prophets.\n\nDespite being a Moabite woman, a folk who had caused quite a number of issues for Bani Israil, Ruth ultimately through her kindness to her israelite mother in law naomi and her own cunning winds up becoming wed to an israelite, eventually bearing a son whose lineage would lead to Dawud himself. Thus, Bani Israil was granted ascendency and salvation from a lineage that was formed by a union to a woman who should have been seen as an enemy. Her lineage through the davidic line also leads down to Maryam and Isa, and thus, christians commemorate her as well in regards to this. Jews see her as a role model of conversion, and her story is typically read on the days of shavaout, due to her story revolving around the harvest season.\n\n**Part 1- From Moab to Bethlehem- Of Joinings and Partings**\n\nSome years prior to the story, a famine had broken out in Israel, and many, particularly in the land of Ephraim, were starving. To combat this, a man by the name of Elimelek, alongside his wife Naomi, and his two sons Mahlon and Killion, went to the neighboring country of Moab. There, they managed to dodge the worst of the famine.\n\nMahlon and Killion went on to marry women from amongst the people of Moab. Killion wed a woman by the name of Orpah, while Mahlon married Ruth. They all then lived in Moab for ten years- but tragedy soon struck. Elimelek soon died a a short time after coming to Moab, and by the end of the ten years, Killion and Mahlon both were dead. The remaining women were all left widowed and grieving.\n\nNow, what makes this particularly interesting, is the fact that Moab of all places was so hospitable to the israelites. In the biblical tradition, Moab was the site for a lot of problems for the children of Israel. For instance, in jewish tradition, they were responsible for the heresy of peor (which essentially was a second golden calf incident- the quran does not mention this incident and while it alludes to balaam- a figure in the story- potentially in 7:175-176, the more lurid and graphic details that are attributed to Musa (up to and including sanctioning of child murder) in this incident are unbecoming of prophethood (and also contradict his character based on what we see in the story of Khidr)- the seriousness of the incident and it's lack of mention also seem to imply that if it did happen, it was likely significantly different, or not at all- the quran's trajectory seems to be that after the golden calf, the next punishment came with the 40 years of wandering). Those of Moab later on went on to war with the children of Israel, particularly in the time of Dawud. At other times, it's stated the people of Moab attacked and oppressed Israel. Additionally, the folk of Moab were polythiestic, and worshipped a god by the name of Chemosh. Yet, it is Moab that shows hospitality to Naomi and her husband and sons, and allows them to live amongst them without threat of violence.\n\nEventually, Naomi recieves news that the famine has abated in Israel and plans to go back. Her daughter-in laws weep in sorrow and both declare to follow her to Israel, but Naomi begs them both to stay in Moab, thanking them for the kindness they had shown her and her family. She urges them to go find new husbands and not to be dragged into her struggles any further. However, they both refuse, and instead say such, seeking to travel with her:\n\nThen Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, \u201cGo back, each of you, to your mother\u2019s home.\u00a0May the\u00a0Lord\u00a0show you kindness,\u00a0as you have shown kindness to your dead husbands\u00a0and to me.\u00a0^(9)\u00a0May the\u00a0Lord\u00a0grant that each of you will find rest\u00a0in the home of another husband.\u201d\n\nThen she kissed\u00a0them goodbye and they wept aloud\u00a0^(10)\u00a0and said to her, \u201cWe will go back with you to your people.\u201d\n\nHowever, Naomi is not deterred, and goes on to state that there is no possibility that she may have new sons considering her age, and she asks them how they could possibly waste years of their life waiting for any hypothetical said sons to grow up to wed. She weeps that the lord has turned against her by affliciting her with misfortune, and that she had nothing left now. The way she speaks is in a despondent, almost self-hating tone of grieving of being in a state of failure:\n\nBut Naomi said, \u201cReturn home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands?\u00a0^(12)\u00a0Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me\u2014even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons\u2014\u00a0^(13)\u00a0would you wait until they grew up?\u00a0Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter\u00a0for me than for you, because the\u00a0Lord\u2019s hand has turned against me!\u201d\n\nWhile this may seem odd, the rationale makes sense. By jewish law, moabites were not allowed into congregations- up to the tenth generation- some even viewing this language as meaning in perpetuity. Naomi likely feared that Orpah and Ruth would face grave discrimination and even danger in Israel at the hands of the religious and political authorities. It is likely even that had word gotten out of Naomi's sons marrying Moabites, it's likely a major fear of Naomi was that it would have been social- or even effectively literal- suicide with grave consequences for them all. To put it bluntly, Ruth was essentially a soon to be illegal immigrant, and Naomi as involved with such.\n\nOrpah reluctantly decides to obey her mother-in-law, but she does not do so silently, wailing as she leaves, with Ruth weeping as well over what has come to pass- and prepares to head back to Moab. For this, many jewish tafsirs and midrash painted Orpah negatively, seeing her leaving as an indication of wanting to go back to Moab's worship of Chemosh and wicked actions, and an archetype of a hypocrite. Some texts go so far as to propose Jalut (Goliath) was one of her descendants.\n\nHowever, the text as is implies this was not an easy decision at all for Orpah. She only leaves to obey her mother in law, and likely out the very real fear that as a moabite, it wouldn't matter what she did- she'd potentially be dead on sight the moment she stepped foot in Israel, no matter how kind she had been to Naomi and her sons- one of which was her husband. The fact that she wept loudly as she left makes it very clear that this was not something she was ecstatic about doing. She obeyed her mother in law despite not wanting to do it, alongside the real fear that she would not be able to be accepted in Israel and the fact that without a husband, security in life would be difficult. This was not an action made to cause malice, but for survival.\n\nRuth on the other hand is stubborn, clinging onto Naomi outright. Naomi begs Ruth to go as well, saying that Orpah is leaving and she should go with her to her people, not wanting to make Ruth struggle any more, which she will should she follow her to Israel, on account of being a foreigner and of a group the israelites have had tensions with in the past. But Ruth replies in a matter that would sound very familiar in some ways to the atmosphere of the shahadah when spoken by converts:\n\n\"Do not urge me to leave you or to turn back from following you; for where you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people will be my people, and your God, my God.\"\n\nIt should be noted that for the most part, this conversion wasn't likely done on religious convictions, but more because Ruth wanted to stay with Naomi.\n\nAt this, Naomi accepts Ruth's conviction, and they prepare to head to Bethlehem. Once there, the townsfolk remark in shock that Naomi has returned, but Naomi replies in sorrow and bitterness that people should not call her that- but  rather Mara- a word meaning bitter- as the lord had given her misery in her years, and she has nothing left. Her name of Naomi means gentleness- and there was little to none of that left in her at this moment.\n\nBy this point, by stroke of luck or otherwise, the two had arrived in Israel at the start of the barley harvesting season- meaning many fields would be busy with working hands- these are the days of Shauvot. To this, sometime after settling in Bethlehem, Ruth makes the decision that in order to gain food (as they are flat broke), she would seek out a field to glean from it (essentially to harvest whatever was remaining from a field after it had already had it's crops harvested/picked). Naomi agrees with the plan, and Ruth sets off, likely relieved to some extent nobody has decided to try anything funny with them on account of her being a moabite, but still weary of what could happen.\n\nBy this point, it's rather clear that due to essentially gleaning off the fields, Ruth and Naomi were in a rather poor situation (literally). With little direct family to turn to, Orpah having gone back to Moab, Ruth's status as a moabite, Naomi being too old to re-wed, having little connection to anybody in Bethlehem to ask for help, and both of them being widowed, there are many things working against them.\n\n**Part 2- The Arrival of Boaz and The Questioning at the Fields**\n\nRuth eventually makes her way to the fields, and begins to glean (picking up food that had been leftover from the actual harvest). This was a right offered to strangers by jewish law- some portions of the field would not be harvested so that strangers or the poor could take the crops- while it was generally seen as being for the jewish poor only, later exegesis allowed for poor gentiles to also benefit. However, considering the texts imply these were meant to be left for the strangers (which in old times would have been pagan folk), it stands to reason the gleaning is for any foreigner or needy person.\n\nIn truth however, Ruth was playing her luck. If the field she was working on due to anti-gentile feelings didn't allow her to glean things could have gotten very hairy for her. Fortunately, the field she was working on was owned by a man named Boaz- who coincidently (and rather luckily) was a relative of Naomi's on her husband's side and belonged to the tribe of Judah. Boaz had come from Bethlehem to tour his fields, which he owned.\n\nBoaz greets the harvesters, as they do to him, and asks their overseer about the young woman that is amongst them, gleaning in the back. The overseer replies that she is a Moabite who came back with naomi, and asked them if she could glean behind the harvesters as they worked. Noting her diligence, the overseer says she had remained in the field for nearly all the day, save for a short rest.\n\nAt this, Boaz turns to Ruth herself, and says that she does not need to glean in another field, nor will she driven off from his. She could stay with the women working in his field, and glean behind them as they worked, while also watching the field where the men did harvests. He mentions that he's ordered his men not to lay a hand on her, and that she can drink from water jars on the property if she is thirsty.\n\nHearing this rather generous offer, Ruth is somewhat (understandably) suspicious. Likely knowing of the tensions that occurred between Moab and Israel, and her and Naomi's destitute state- she isn't sure what the catch behind all of this kindness from a clearly powerful man is- at best case, Boaz might condescend her, worst case she might get taken advantage of and indirectly cause difficulty to Naomi as a result. So to this end, she looks down to her feet as she speaks to Boaz and asks why she has found such favor with him- noting she was a foreigner. For her, all of this happening out of the blue likely seems a little too good to be true.\n\nTo this, Boaz replies that he had heard of how Ruth had treated Naomi and how she had travelled with her to someplace entirely foreign simply to support her. Stating that such a thing was commendable, he states that he hopes god will repay her richly for the good she has done. Ruth replies that she hopes she can find further favor in that case, and that she is at ease that Boaz spoke kindly to her- even if she is not of the same standing as his servants. Here, Ruth likely breathes a sigh of relief at the fact that Boaz isn't treating her as less simply because she isn't in the \"in-group\" so to speak.\n\nSoon enough, Boaz invites her to have a meal of bread dipped in wine vinegar, along with some roasted grain. Having eaten her fill, she gets up to glean again. Boaz now gives new orders to his men- allowing Ruth to gather not only from the fields, but also from the sheaves- harvested bundles of grain that had been tied together. He even goes so far as to say that the men should take a few stalks out of the bundles and drop them on the ground for her to pick up.\n\nWhat's particularly interesting about this is that Boaz in truth goes above and beyond the rules on giving aid to the stranger. On top of that, he isn't all too banged up about Ruth being a moabite and having married an israelite, something that would have likely been seen as scandalous.\n\nWith all this in mind, Ruth manages to gain quite a bit of grain- the amount being around 30 pounds after she threshes it. After carying said grain back to Bethlehem, and sharing it with Naomi so she has something to eat, Naomi is a little shocked but happily suprised that she was able to find food. She excitedly asks Ruth where she did her work, and under who. Ruth mentions Boaz, and Naomi is estatic, thanking the lord that Boaz was kind to both his living and dead relatives. Ruth mentions that Boaz had extended an offer that she could continue gleaning at his fields until the harvesting was done at them. Naomi urges Ruth to take up the offer, as Boaz has clearly stipulated she will be protected from harrasment due to Boaz being their kin- noting that on any other field she may not be lucky enough to not be harmed, without such a promise.\n\nWith this in mind, Ruth continues her gleaning on Boaz's fields. Meanwhile, noticing the rather decent situation they have going on, Naomi begins to plan on how to make sure it continues in their favor....\n\n**Part 3- The Scheme of the Threshing Floor- Engineering a Marriage Proposal for Economic Stability**\n\nSome time later, Naomi speaks to Ruth, saying that as her mother in law, she needs to make sure that Ruth has a good home she can marry into so she will be provided for. Pointing out that Boaz was a relation of theirs, and that Ruth has some familiarty with him, he seems a good canidate. To this end, Naomi outlines a scheme for Ruth to best convince him. And by convince, Naomi means somewhat sort of charm him in order to marry him.\n\nHer plan is to take advantage of the fact that Boaz will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor that night. To get prepared, she needs to take a bath, put on perfume, and wear her best clothes. Then, she needs to sneak down to the threshing floor in the dead of night, not get noticed by anybody on the way there to avoid any possible rumor leaks, and not make it obvious she's there once she's on the floor. Once he's finished eating and drinking, and is getting ready to lie down (probably to take a nap or to guard the grain), Ruth needs to uncover his feet and lie down near him. Essentially, she needs to infiltrate her way into potentially getting a marriage proposal to ensure financial stability and material safety for herself and her mother in law. No pressure.\n\nRuth agrees to the plan, and sneaks off to the threshing floor. Once she notices Boaz getting ready to lie down on the far end of a grain pile, she quickly sneaks forward, uncovers his feet and lays down near him. Boaz winds up waking up sometime in the middle of the night only to find Ruth randomly near him. Somewhat groggy, he asks who on earth she is.\n\nRuth then informs him that she is Ruth- and does something even bolder- she makes the first move and proposes him for marriage. Naomi's plan was for her to simply wait for Boaz to spread the blanket on her to signify such a proposal, but Ruth instead flips the script on it's head. Boaz is heartened by this, and honored to have been as such by Ruth- but he mentions there is another person in Bethlehem who could potentially do the job better than him. Thus, Boaz will ask about him before he pushes his suit forward.\n\nThus, Ruth winds up taking the initiative and successfully advancing the plan Naomi had called upon her to do. However, with the revelation of a possible second candidate at play, things aren't finished just yet...\n\n**Part 4- The Finalization of Contracts, The Exchange of the Slippers, and the Birth of The Davidic Line**\n\nJust as Boaz mentions, the other potential marriage candiate is within Bethlehem, and so Boaz decides to gather them and ten elders living in the town to preside over Ruth's case. He states clearly about Naomi, qwho is in the midst of selling land that had been held by her husband  Elimelek. He states that with this land will also comes Ruth's hand in marriage. While the competitor initially agrees to the sale, he backs off as marrying Ruth will in his own words endanger his own estate and affairs. At this, Boaz proceeds to do the standard rite in those days for the property transfer to be established- which involved handing one's sandal/footwear to the other party- thus, the comptetior gives up his sandal to Boaz to establish this.\n\nAt this, Boaz publicly announces that he is now in charge of Elimelek's land, and will marry Ruth (there is a somewhat patriarchal tone to this in how Ruth is associated as being part of the sale, but at times Ruth also subverts patriarchal norms at the time in taking the intiative for her marriage and carving out a place for herself by not being demure). This is established, and there is much celebration in Bethlehem. Boaz and Ruth would go on to have a son by the name of Obed- who would in turn have a son by the name of Jesse. And it was Jesse who was the father of Dawud. Thus, through a series of misadventures and trials of a woman who should have been seen as an enemy and cast out- she who was of the mushrikeen- Israel won itself a road to future salvation and the start of a lineage of prophets which would lead to Isa himself.\n\nOverall, this story showcases the importance of hospitality and treating the stranger kindly, as well as keeping ties of kinship. And it is just this (moreso the former two) we see Ibrahim and Lut do in their portions of the story when angels come to them. Ibrahim sacrifices a goat to feed them, and while the angels do not eat of it (something the quran is in agreement with in regards to late second temple period exegesis- implying angels likely have different food sources then humans, if they do eat something to sustain themselves), and Lut tries to draw away danger from his guests (though likely not by offering his daughters up, but by taking advantage of their own xenophobic customs by disgusing his angels as being his visiting daughters). Much like Boaz who treated Ruth kindly, they do the same.\n\nHere, we see how hospitality is a key and crucial feature of the scriptures, and a virtue. In light of that, reading Lut as the mainstream reading does denies this idea, and only ascribes to him the deeds of the Levite at Gibeah.  To say that the quran reveres him (as it says that he was favored) in light of this would be a horrendous idea to advance. In truth, unless we take another reading than the mainstream one, there is no way to preserve Lut's moral integrity- and in truth, we run the danger of ascribing an incredibly horrible action to him, something the people in Maryam's time were cursed for doing regarding her (4:156). Additionally, the idea of sacrificing his daughters makes Lut akin to the tale of Jepthath and his daughter (mentioned in Judges 11), which is also seen as a bad thing. \n\nOverall, the mainstream view in light of the past revelations not only makes no sense, it defames Lut utterly, especially in light of the past traditions. The mainstream view's objection on the idea of reinterpreting Lut's story as rape (despite that being less convoluted and unsteady overall) is often that somehow this means that Lut is implying the rape of a woman is preferable to a rape of a man- but in reality, their usage of this being in regards to marriage is no better- only labelling Lut as being like the Levite at Gibeah- in truth, they already are doing this.
