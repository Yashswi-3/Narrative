        "Title": "\ud83d\udce3 I want to debunk Reddit's claims, and talk about their unwillingness to work with developers, moderators, and the larger community, as well as say thank you for all the support",
        "Body/Content": "I wanted to address Reddit's continued, provably false statements, as well as answer some questions from the community, and also just say thanks.\n\n*(Before beginning, to the uninitiated, \"the Reddit API\" is just how apps and tools talk with Reddit to get posts in a subreddit, comments on a post, upvote, reply, etc.)*\n\n# Reddit: \"Developers don't want to pay\"\n\nSteve Huffman on June 15th: \"These people who are mad, they\u2019re mad because they used to get something for free, and now it\u2019s going to be not free. And that free comes at the expense of our other users and our business. That\u2019s what this is about. It can\u2019t be free.\"\n\nThis is the false argument Steve Huffman keeps repeating the most. Developers are *very* happy to pay. Why? Reddit has many APIs (like voting in polls, Reddit Chat, view counts, etc.) that they haven't made available to developers, and a more formal relationship with Reddit has the opportunity to create a better API experience with more features available. I expressed this willingness to pay many times throughout phone calls and emails, for instance here's one on literally the very first phone call:\n\n> \"I'm honestly looking forward to the pricing and the stuff you're rolling out provided it's enough to keep me with a job. You guys seem nothing but reasonable, so I'm looking to finding out more.\"\n\nWhat developers **do** have issue with, is the unreasonably high pricing that you originally claimed would be \"based in reality\", as well as the incredibly short 30 days you've given developers from when you announced pricing to when developers start incurring massive charges. Charging developers [29x higher than your average revenue per user](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) is not \"based in reality\".\n\n# Reddit: \"We're happy to work with those who want to work with us.\"\n\nNo, you are not.\n\nI outlined numerous suggestions that would lead to Apollo being able to survive, even settling on the most basic: just give me a bit more time. At that point, a week passed without Reddit even answering my email, not even so much as a \"We hear you on the timeline, we're looking into it.\" Instead the communication they *did* engage in was telling internal employees, and then moderators publicly, that I was trying to blackmail them.\n\nBut was it just me who they weren't working with? \n\n- Many developers during Steve Huffman's AMA expressed how for several months they'd sent emails upon emails to Reddit about the API changes and received absolutely no response from Reddit ([one example](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/comment/jnk2pp3), [another example](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/comment/jnk2q0e)). In what world is that \"working with developers\"?\n- Steve Huffman said \"We have had many conversations \u2014 well, not with Reddit is Fun, he never wanted to talk to us\". The Reddit is Fun developer [shared emails with The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/16/23763661/reddit-rif-is-fun-developer-ceo-steve-huffman) showing how he outlined many suggestions to Reddit, none of which were listened to. I know this as well, because I was talking with Andrew throughout all of this.\n\nReddit themselves promised they would listen on our call:\n\n> \"I just want to say this again, I know that we've said it already, but like, we want to work with you to find a mutually beneficial financial arrangement here. Like, I want to really underscore this point, like, we want to find something that works for both parties. This is meant to be a conversation.\"\n\nI know the other developers, we have a group chat. We've proposed so many solutions to Reddit on how this could be handled better, and they have not listened to an ounce of what we've said. \n\nAsk yourself genuinely: has this whole process felt like a conversation where Reddit wants to work with both parties?\n\n# Reddit: \"We're not trying to be like Twitter/Elon\"\n\nTwitter famously destroyed third-party apps a few months before Reddit did when Elon took over. When I asked about this, Reddit responded:\n\n> Reddit: \"I think one thing that we have tried to be very, very, very intentional about is we are not Elon, we're not trying to be that. We're not trying to go down that same path, we're not trying to, you know, kind of blow anyone out of the water.\"\n\nSteve Huffman showed how untrue this statement was in [an interview with NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/reddit-blackout-protest-private-ceo-elon-musk-huffman-rcna89700) last week:\n\n> In an interview Thursday with NBC News, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman praised Musk\u2019s aggressive cost-cutting and layoffs at Twitter, and said he had chatted \u201ca handful of times\u201d with Musk on the subject of running an internet platform. \n> \n> Huffman said he saw Musk\u2019s handling of Twitter, which he purchased last year, as an example for Reddit to follow. \n> \n> \u201cLong story short, my takeaway from Twitter and Elon at Twitter is reaffirming that we can build a really good business in this space at our scale,\u201d Huffman said. \n\n# Reddit: \"The Apollo developer is threatening us\"\n\nSteve Huffman on June 7th on a call with moderators:\n\n> Steve Huffman: \"Apollo threatened us, said they\u2019ll \u201cmake it easy\u201d if Reddit gave them $10 million. This guy behind the scenes is coercing us. He's threatening us.\"\n\nAs mentioned in the last post, thankfully I recorded the phone call and can show this to be false, to the extent that Reddit *even apologized four times for misinterpreting it*:\n\n> Reddit: \"That's a complete misinterpretation on my end. I apologize. I apologize immediately.\"\n\n(Note: as Steve declined to ever talk on a call, the call is with a Reddit representative)\n\n([Full transcript](https://christianselig.com/apollo-end/reddit-call-transcript.txt), [audio](https://christianselig.com/apollo-end/reddit-third-call-may-31-end.m4a))\n\nDespite this, Reddit and Steve Huffman still went on to repeat this potentially career-ending lie about me internally, and publicly to moderators, and have yet to apologize in any capacity, instead Steve's AMA has shown anger about the call being posted.\n\nSteve, I genuinely ask you: if I had made potentially career-ending accusations of blackmail against you, and you had evidence to show that was completely false, would you not have defended yourself?\n\n# Reddit: \"Christian has been saying one thing to us while saying something completely different externally\"\n\nIn Steve Huffman's AMA, a user asked why he attempted to discredit me through tales of blackmail. Rather than apologizing, Steve said: \n\n> \"His behavior and communications with us has been all over the place\u2014saying one thing to us while saying something completely different externally.\"\n\nI responded: \n\n> \"Please feel free to give examples where I said something differently in public versus what I said to you. I give you full permission.\"\n\nI genuinely have no clue what he's talking about, and as more than a week has passed once more, and Reddit continues to insist on making up stories, I think the onus is on me to show all the communication Steve Huffman and I have had, in order to show that I have been consistent throughout my communication, detailing that I simply want my app to not die, and offering simple suggestions that would help, to which they stopped responding:\n\nhttps://christianselig.com/apollo-end/reddit-steve-email-conversation.txt\n\n# Reddit: \"They threw in the towel and don't want to work with us\"\n\nAgain, this is demonstrably false as shown above. I did not throw in the towel, you stopped communicating with me, to this day still not answering anything, and elected to spread lies about me. This forced my hand to shut down, as I only had weeks before I would start incurring massive charges, you showed zero desire to work with me, and I needed to begin to work with Apple on the process of refunding users with yearly subscriptions.\n\n# Reddit: \"We don't want to kill third-party apps\"\n\n**That is what you achieved**. So you are either very inept at making plans that accomplish a goal, you're lying, or both.\n\nIf that wasn't your intention, you would have listened to developers, not had a terrible AMA, not had an enormous blackout, and not refused to listen to this day.\n\n# Reddit: \"Third-party apps don't provide value.\"\n\n(Per an interview with [The Verge](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/reddits-ceo-says-third-party-apps-add-no-value-hes-measuring-it-all-wrong.html).)\n\nI could refute the \"not providing value\" part myself, but I will let Reddit argue with itself through statements they've made to me over the course of our calls:\n\n>  \"We think that developers have added to the Reddit user experience over the years, and I don't think that there's really any debating that they've been additive to the ecosystem on Reddit and we want to continue to acknowledge that.\"\n\nAnother:\n\n> \"Our developer community has in many ways saved Reddit through some difficult times. I know in no small part, your work, when we did not have a functioning app. And not just you obviously, but it's been our developers that have helped us weather a lot of storms and adapt and all that.\"\n\nAnother:\n\n> \"Just coming back to the sentiment inside of Reddit is that I think our development community has really been a huge part why we've survived as long as we have.\"\n\n# Reddit: \"No plans to change the API in 2023\"\n\nOn one call in January, I asked Reddit about upcoming plans for the API so I could do some planning for the year. They responded:\n\n> \"So I would expect no change, certainly not in the short to medium term. And we're talking like order of years.\"\n\nAnd then went on to say: \n\n> \"There's not gonna be any change on it. There's no plans to, there's no plans to touch it right now in 2023.\"\n\nSo I just want to be clear that not only did they not provide developers much time to deal with this massive change, they said earlier in the year that it wouldn't even happen.\n\n# Reddit's hostility toward moderators\n\nThere's an overall tone from Reddit along the lines of \"Moderators, get in line or we'll replace you\" that I think is incredibly, incredibly disrespectful.\n\nOther websites like Facebook pay literally [hundreds of millions of dollars](https://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/cognizant-getting-200m-from-facebook-to-moderate-violent-content-amid-allegations-of-filthy-work-conditions-report) for moderators on their platform. Reddit is incredibly fortunate, if not exploitative, to get this labor completely free from unpaid, volunteer users.\n\nThe core thing to keep in mind is that **these are not easy jobs that hundreds of people are lining up to undertake**. Moderators of large subreddits have indicated the difficulty in finding quality moderators. It's a really tough job, you're moderating potentially millions upon millions of users, wherein even an incredibly small percentage could make your life hell, and wading through an absolutely gargantuan amount of content. Further, every community is different and presents unique challenges to moderate, an approach or system that works in one subreddit may not work at all in another.\n\nDo a better job of recognizing the entirety of Reddit's value, through its content and moderators, are built on free labor. That's not to say you don't have bills to keep the lights on, or engineers to pay, but treat them with respect and recognize the fortunate situation you're in.\n\n# What a real leader would have done\n\nAt every juncture of this self-inflicted crisis, Reddit has shown poor management and decision making, and I've heard some users ask how it could have been better handled. Here are some steps I believe a competent leader would have undertaken:\n\n- Perform basic research. For instance: Is the official app missing incredibly basic features for moderators, like even being able to see the [Moderator Log](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/tk5h9b/anyway_to_look_at_the_mod_log_on_mobile/)? Or, [do blind people exist](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/1447ibp/what_apps_meet_your_access_needs/)?\n- Work on a realistic timeline for developers. If it took you 43 days from [announcing the desire to charge](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) to [even decide what the pricing would be](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/13wsiks/api_update_enterprise_level_tier_for_large_scale/), perhaps 30 days is too short from when the pricing is announced to when developers could be start incurring literally millions of dollars in charges? It's common practice to give 1 year, and other companies like Dark Sky when deprecating their weather API literally gave 30 **months**. Such a length of time is not necessary in this case, but goes to show how extraordinarily and harmfully short Reddit's deadline was.\n- Talk to developers. Not responding to emails for weeks or months is not acceptable, nor is not listening to an ounce of what developers are able to communicate to you.\n\nIn the event that these are too difficult, you blunder the launch, and frustrate users, developers, and moderators alike:\n\n- Apologize, recognize that the process was not handled well, and pledge to do better, talking and listening to developers, moderators, and the community this time\n\n# Why can't you just charge $5 a month or something?\n\nThis is a really easy one: Reddit's prices are too high to permit this.\n\nIt may not surprise you to know, but users who are willing to pay for a service typically use it more. Apollo's existing subscription users use on average 473 requests per day. This is more than an average free user (240) because, unsurprisingly, they use the app more. Under Reddit's API pricing, those users would cost $3.52 monthly. You take out Apple's cut of the $5, and some fees of my own to keep Apollo running, and you're literally losing money every month.\n\nAnd that's your *average* user, a large subset of those, around 20%, use between 1,000 and 2,000 requests per day, which would cost $7.50 and $15.00 per month *each* in fees alone, which I have a hard time believing anyone is going to want to pay.\n\nI'm far from the only one seeing this, the Relay for Reddit developer, initially somewhat hopeful of being able to make a subscription work, [ran the same calculations](https://www.reddit.com/r/RelayForReddit/comments/14bluna/comment/jogj9zr) and found similar results to me.\n\n**By my count that is literally every single one of the most popular third-party apps having concluded this pricing is untenable.**\n\nAnd remember, [from some basic calculations](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) of Reddit's own disclosed numbers, Reddit appears to make on average approximately $0.12 per user per month, so you can see how charging developers $3.52 (or 29x higher) per user is not \"based in reality\" as they previously promised. That's why this pricing is unreasonable.\n\n# Can I use Apollo with my own API key after June 30th?\n\nNo, Reddit [has said this is not allowed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infinity_For_Reddit/comments/14c7v84/comment/jokqfe4/?context=1).\n\n# Refund process/Pixel Pals\n\nAnnual subscribers with time left on their subscription as of July 1st will automatically receive a pro-rated refund for the time remaining. I'm working with Apple to offer a process [similar to Tweetbot/Twitterrific](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/02/tweetbot-twitterrific-subscription-refunds/) wherein users can decline the refund if they so choose, but that process requires some internal working but I'll have more details on that as soon as I know anything. Apple's estimates are in line with mine that the amount I'll be on the hook to refund will be about $250,000.\n\nNot to turn this into an infomercial, but that is a lot of money, and if you appreciate my work I also have a fun separate [virtual pets app called Pixel Pals](https://pixelpals.app) that it would mean a lot to me if you checked out and supported (I've got a cool update coming out this week!). If you're looking for a more direct route, Apollo also has a tip jar at the top of Settings, and if that's inaccessible, I also have a tipjar@apolloapp.io PayPal. Please only support/tip if you easily have the means, ultimately I'll be fine.\n\n# Thanks\n\nThanks again for the support. It's been really hard to so quickly lose something that you built for nine years and allowed you to connect with hundreds of thousands of other people, but I can genuinely say it's made it a lot easier for us developers to see folks being so supportive of us, it's like a million little hugs.\n\n\\- Christian",

Reproducing some of it here for those who can't access it. \n\n> Dear Mods,\n> \n> We want to let you know that your community has been quarantined, as outlined in Reddit\u2019s Content Policy.\n> \n> The reason for the quarantine is that over the last few months we have observed repeated rule-breaking behavior in your community and an over-reliance on Reddit admins to manage users and remove posts that violate our content policy, including content that encourages or incites violence. Most recently, we have observed this behavior in the form of encouragement of violence towards police officers and public officials in Oregon. This is not only in violation of our site-wide policies, but also your own community rules (rule #9). You can find violating content that we removed in your mod logs.\n>\n>...\n>\n> Next steps:\n> \n> You unambiguously communicate to your subscribers that violent content is unacceptable.\n> \n> You communicate to your users that reporting is a core function of Reddit and is essential to maintaining the health and viability of the community.\n> \n> Following that, we will continue to monitor your community, specifically looking at report rate and for patterns of rule-violating content.\n> \n> Undertake any other actions you determine to reduce the amount of rule-violating content.\n> \n> Following these changes, we will consider an appeal to lift the quarantine, in line with the process outlined here.\n\nA screenshot of the modlog with [admin removals](https://magaimg.net/img/8ax3.png) was also shared.\n\nAbout 4 hours after the quarantine, the previous sticky about it was removed and replaced with [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/c5vgga/rule_1_violence_and_what_it_means_help_us_help_you/) one instructing T_D users about violence\n\nWe've recieved a modmail from a leaker in a private T_D subreddit that was a \"secret 'think tank' of reddit's elite top minds\".

The Court ruled 6\u20133 that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, overturning both Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and returning \"the authority to regulate abortion\" to the states.\n\nJustice Alito delivered the majority opinion, joined by Justices Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett. Justices Thomas, Kavanaugh, and Chief Justice Roberts each filed concurring opinions, while Justices Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan dissented.\n\nThe ruling can be found here: https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf\n\n---\n\n##Submissions that may interest you\n\nSUBMISSION | DOMAIN\n---|----\n[Right-Wing Supreme Court Overturns Roe, Eliminating Constitutional Right to Abortion in US](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/06/24/right-wing-supreme-court-overturns-roe-eliminating-constitutional-right-abortion-us) | commondreams.org\n[In historic reversal, Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade, frees states to outlaw abortion](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-06-24/supreme-court-overturns-roe-vs-wade-frees-states-to-outlaw-abortion) | latimes.com\n[Supreme Court overturns Roe v.

        "Body/Content": "I sobbed through the last 20 mins of the new Netflix movie, [Don\u2019t Look Up](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11286314/). I\u2019ve been fighting climate change and pollution for decades. I am enraged, because I have the same feeling portrayed by many of the character that, \u201cdamn, we can to fix our problems, but we just won\u2019t.\u201d\n###This movie is about climate change, capitalism, and greed. \n\nIt was written by two folks, one of which is [David Sirota](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1998503/). David was Bernie Sanders\u2019 speech writer during his 2020 campaign. \n\nOur leaders have failed us just like the fictional leaders in this movie. **The scientific community is ringing every alarm about climate change**. Once the tropics reach the [Wet Bulb Temperature](https://climatematters.substack.com/p/heat-stress-tropics) for humanity, they will be a death-zone. Large regions of the tropics will be uninhabitable - soon. We\u2019re so fucked.\n\nBut are we doing anything about it?\n#No\n\nBillionaires like Gates, Bezos, Musk, and 100s of old fucks you\u2019ve never heard of are laughing all the way to the bank. They are willing to sacrifice workers, even entire countries, for the imaginary thing we call money. \n- Money doesn\u2019t exist in nature, we made it up. \n- Climate change and pollution do exist. \n\nWe cannot continue to stand by as our home is ravaged for fake people points. We deserve clean air and water. They have no right to do that to us. The economy is a SHAM. We are all slaves. \n\nWorkers of the world, stop this madness. We control our fate, but we have to look up. We have to see the forest for the trees. We have to say enough is enough. We have to prevent our own destruction. \n\nThe economy/capitalism is anti-humanity. We must save ourselves.\n\nWe have to stop consuming mindlessly. Stop buying junk on the internet.\nBoycott as many corporations as you can manage. **Workers around the world need to strike, and we need to support them**. Continued compliance with our overlords will be our downfall.\n\n#Organize your workplace\nContact the [Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee - EWOC](https://workerorganizing.org/) or a union in your area/industry. EWOCs services are free and confidential. If you fill out the form on their website, a real life volunteer will contact you to discuss your workplace and brainstorm steps to form a union.\n\nChannel your fear into change - [Common Dreams 30-Day Climate Action Plan](https://www.commondreams.org/views/2021/12/25/feeling-hopeless-about-climate-try-our-30-day-action-plan).\n\nEdit: Damn, what a sleep. Made some minor edits.\n\n#Climate change is currently being accelerated by humanity. \nTrolls and science deniers will be blocked. \n\nThanks for the awards. Instead of me, consider making a donation to [Democracy Now!](https://www.democracynow.org/) or another independent journalist.\n\nEdit 2:\n#Register to vote, wherever you are\nhttps://www.usa.gov/voter-registration/\n\nThe largest block of voters in the US is non-voters. We need to activate those folks who feel hopeless. They must participate. If you live in the US and have vacation time, try to takeoff as many days as possible leading up to the midterm election. Volunteer as a driver or poll worker.\n#Solidarity to all members of the working class\n\nEdit 3: A few more words changed. \n\nRepublicans and Democrats are different wings of the same bird. Don\u2019t **vote blue no matter who**. Vote as left as possible, every chance you get. \n\nAnd yes, I too think the actors in this film are part of the problem. The message of the film is what enraged me, not the *star-studded* cast. \n##Fuck celebrities\nThey are not going to save us.\n\nPs: The script was written in 2019 and production was suppose to start in Spring 2020. It\u2019s about climate change.\n\nEdit 4: We have the tech.\n- Cars and airplanes are bringing about ecocide. We need to go back to trains and sailboats.\n- Micro-plastics already exist in every waterway. Petroleum products need to go. \n- We should be using glass, wood, and other naturally occurring, renewable materials. \n\nWe don\u2019t have electric trains throughout our communities, primarily because auto manufacturers illegally destroy such systems in the 40s and 50s. \n\n[Here\u2019s an example from the LA area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy). The same happened in many metro areas. [Jaywalking laws were invented by the US automotive industry. ](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26073797) Teslas are not a solution to climate change. They are fancy toys for rich people. **Elon is a robber baron, born with a silver spoon in his mouth.**\n\nEdit 5: Added some links.\n\nEdit 6: Turning off notifications. **Woof**. \n\nSolidarity to everyone who was nice. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. To folks who disagreed with me, I hope to see eye-to-eye one day. \n\n**Health, love, and solidarity to every member of the working class.**\n#Happy New Year\n\ud83d\udc4a *Resolve To Organize Your Workplace In 2022* \ud83d\udc4a",

Sondland said the connection between these two issues was widely known throughout the administration. \"I know that members of this Committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a \u2018quid pro quo?\u2019 As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes,\" Sondland said in his opening statement. He also said he worked with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine issues on \"the president\u2019s orders,\" confirming Trump\u2019s active participation in a controversy that threatens his presidency.\n\n[Link to discussion thread Part IV](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dz5t45/discussion_thread_day_four_of_house_public/)\n\n\n[Link to Sondland opening statement](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/20/us/politics/gordon-sondland-opening-statement-ukraine.html)\n\n---\n\n##Submissions that may interest you\n\nSUBMISSION | DOMAIN\n---|----\n[Sondland Testifies Explicit Ukraine Quid Pro Quo Came From Trump and Everyone Was In on It](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/11/sondland-impeachment-testimony-implicates-giuliani-pompeo-trump-ukraine-quid-pro-quo.html) | slate.com\n[Trump's top impeachment defender gets Sondland's job title wrong -- three times](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/20/politics/pam-bondi-gordon-sondland-ukraine-impeachment/index.html) | cnn.com\n[Sondland testimony targets Trump, Pompeo and confirms deal with Ukraine](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/sondland-testimony-targets-trump-pompeo-confirms-deal-ukraine-n1086541) | nbcnews.com\n[U.S. diplomat Sondland says he followed president's orders on Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment/u-s-diplomat-sondland-says-he-followed-presidents-orders-on-ukraine-idUSKBN1XU1BO) | reuters.com\n[Ambassador Gordon Sondland testifies there was a quid pro quo in Trump\u2019s Ukraine dealings](https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/ambassador-gordon-sondland-testifies-there-was-a-quid-pro-quo-in-trumps-ukraine-dealings/) | nypost.com\n[\u2018I Followed the Directions of the President.\u2019 Read Gordon Sondland\u2019s Explosive Impeachment Testimony](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/gordon-sondland-explosive-testimony-impeachment-915048/) | rollingstone.com\n[Trump behind Ukraine pressure, Sondland tells impeachment inquiry](https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-gordon-sondland-impeachment-trump-ukraine-20191120-kpgdce77ejd4nip2siwzxi2f7q-story.html) | nydailynews.com\n[Gordon Sondland Blames Ukraine Scandal on Trump](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/11/gordon-sondland-blames-ukraine-scandal-on-trump/) | motherjones.com\n[Sondland confirms 'quid pro quo,' points finger directly at Trump](https://theweek.com/speedreads/879653/sondland-confirms-quid-pro-quo-points-finger-directly-trump) | theweek.com\n[Gordon Sondland: I worked \"at the express direction of the president\"](https://www.axios.com/gordon-sondland-trump-impeachment-opening-statement-25c69f9d-cd4c-4f6f-b831-92aa9c72adf7.html) | axios.com\n[Sondland to testify quid pro quo in Ukraine was real and widely known](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/471247-sondland-to-testify-quid-pro-quo-in-ukraine-was-real-and-widely-known) | thehill.com\n[U.S. Ambassador Sondland says he followed Trump's orders on Ukraine](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment-testimony/u-s-ambassador-sondland-says-he-followed-trumps-orders-on-ukraine-idUSKBN1XU1S3) | reuters.com\n[Trump impeachment: Key witness Sondland says president 'directed' quid pro quo, in explosive testimony to congress](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-impeachment-sondland-testimony-ukraine-giuliani-biden-pompeo-bolton-a9210801.html) | independent.co.uk\n[Sondland: \u2018Was there a quid pro quo?

The investment didn't pan out: Yang finished with just 1% support in Iowa and, after leaving the state with depleted resources, had to lay off staff as he looked to trim his campaign's costs.\n\n---\n\n##Submissions that may interest you\n\nSUBMISSION | DOMAIN\n---|----\n[Andrew Yang to End His Presidential

It is unfair, and it's been very unfair.\"\n\nThe order comes after the president escalated his attacks against Big Tech in recent days \u2014 specifically Twitter, which fact-checked him for the first time this week over an unsubstantiated claim that mail-in voting drives voter fraud.\n\n---\n\n##Submissions that may interest you\n\nSUBMISSION | DOMAIN\n---|----\n[Trump signs executive order aimed at social media companies](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-twitter-executive-order-1.5589034) | cbc.ca\n[Donald Trump Signs Exec Order to Curb Big Tech's 'Unchecked Power'](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/05/28/donald-trump-signs-exec-order-to-curb-big-techs-unchecked-power/) | breitbart.com\n[Trump says he would shut down Twitter if there was a way to do so legally](https://www.axios.com/trump-twitter-shut-down-d28eb112-6bfe-49bc-aeb1-2214e607bf4d.html?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=organic&utm_content=1100&fbclid=IwAR3uVdb9sDQzzG5ewDmfnfyV076GQDSAk_1rGlEQGwB-qZBaXnr5zjpCCSA) | axios.com\n[Trump Signs Executive Order Targeting Twitter, Facebook That Legal Experts Say Is Likely Unconstitutional](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/trump-executive-order-targets-twitter-facebook-1234619250/) | variety.com\n[Trump said he wanted to shut down Twitter moments after signing an executive order emphasizing his 'commitment to free and open debate on the internet'](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-says-shut-down-twitter-while-attacking-it-censorship-2020-5) | businessinsider.com\n[Stung By Twitter, Trump Signs Executive Order To Weaken Social Media Companies](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/28/863932758/stung-by-twitter-trump-signs-executive-order-to-weaken-social-media-companies?origin=NOTIFY) | npr.org\n[President Trump signs executive order, which will open social media companies to lawsuits](https://www.wxyz.com/news/national/president-trump-signs-executive-order-which-will-open-social-media-companies-to-lawsuits) | wxyz.com\n[Trump's social media order to have agencies review whether Twitter, Facebook can be sued for content](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/05/28/trump-social-media-order-expected-go-after-twitter-facebook/5265312002/) | usatoday.com\n[Trump signs Social Media Executive order after being \"factchecked\" by Twitter](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-executive-order-twitter_n_5ecf5a81c5b6791a3c29f66b?fbclid=IwAR2hICscsVFsbXS-eiko__JAWpaWzcO1IjeArsjSonkt_TFns2Dklbyy_-M) | huffpost.com\n[It\u2019s Unclear What Trump\u2019s Section 230 Executive Order Will Do Beyond Bully Social Media Companies](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/trump-executive-order-section-230-twitter-fact-checking) | buzzfeednews.com\n[Trump signs executive order aimed at social media companies after fuming over fact-check](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/angry-over-how-social-media-platforms-are-treating-him-trump-n1216401?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_np) | nbcnews.com\n[Trump signs executive order targeting Twitter, Facebook](https://www.cnet.com/news/trump-signs-executive-order-targeting-twitter-facebook/) | cnet.com\n[Trump takes aim at Twitter employee amid crusade against company for fact check label](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-takes-aim-twitter-employee-amid-crusade-against-company-fact-n1216631) | nbcnews.com\n[Trump's social media order will have the opposite effect he wants, tech experts warn](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/28/tech-industry-warns-that-trumps-executive-order-will-chill-speech.html) | cnbc.com\n[Trump signs executive order aimed at punishing social media companies after Twitter fact-checks him](https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-trump-social-media-20200528-asp2iwmg4beu3lff35dbyir36u-story.html) | nydailynews.com\n[Trump signs executive order threatening social media companies after Twitter fact-checked his tweets](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-signs-executive-order-threatening-twitter-facebook-conservative-bias-2020-5) | businessinsider.com\n[Experts say Trump's order aimed at Twitter, other tech giants could prove toothless, face legal challenge](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/experts-trumps-order-aimed-twitter-tech-giants-prove/story?id=70929378) | abcnews.go.com\n[Moments Ago: Trump signs executive order regarding social media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_AJWZ01X94&feature=emb_title) | youtube.com\n[\u201cTrump signs order targeting social media companies\u201d.

PublicFreakout is nowadays filled only with violence from the roads. You unfollow them and look the positive subs.\n\nCops helping a baby who's just about to die, a small kid donating her restaurant food to homeless and her dad being proud of it, people motivating each other to fight depression - these are the things you should have more in your life.\n\nPS - You can still be active about protests like BLM without following PublicFreakout. Just read the newspapers. Or maybe one video once in a while to be aware.\n\nBonus tip: Unfollow people who always spew hate on Twitter. Follow what people who are artists or experts in the field you like. I unfollowed political activists and followed tech experts. I can happily look at my Twitter feed now.\n\nIf you want good subs\nTo actually laugh out loud - \n\nr/funny\n\nr/memes\n\nr/jokes\n\nr/dankmemes\n\nr/cursedcomments - Funniest comments on the internet\n\nr/madlads - People doing the craziest things\n\nr/AccidentalComedy \n\n\nTo motivate yourself or uplift yourself or renew your faith in humanity -\n\nr/MadeMeSmile - The best one if you ask me\n\nr/MadeMeCry\n\nr/wholesomememes\n\nr/HumansBeingBros - You see the most generous people here\n\nr/UpliftingNews\n\nr/ContagiousLaughter\n\nr/happycrowds\n\nr/Positive_News\n\n\nTo watch something adorable and go aww..\n\nr/aww\n\nr/Eyebleach\n\nr/AnimalsBeingBros\n\nr/AnimalsBeingDerps\n\nr/rarepuppers\n\nr/Zoomies\n\nAnd then there's all kinds of cute animal subs (even rats and snakes). Just search for the animal you like.\n\nEdit: Two awards. Damn! Thank you people. I guess spreading happiness gives you happiness.\nEdit 2: Removed GetMotivated. It never helped me but I thought it helped others. But a lot of backlash here.",

        "Title": "I believe: Free Markets Cannot Be Free, Unless They Are Fair. So I stand now, and choose to fight. My name is Alexander Ross Cohen. I am an APE. I have been a Humanitarian, Teacher, Lawyer, Builder, Founder and Father. I have been a SuperStonk Mod since Day One. Today, I step back, to lean in.\ud83d\udc8e\u270a",
        "Body/Content": "# One Step Back\n\nTwo weeks ago today I gave Mods notice of my intent to take an indefinite hiatus and I stepped back from my Mod responsibilities, but not away from this Community.  Today that self-imposed hiatus comes to an end as I make the somber decision to\u00a0resign my role as a SuperStonk Mod.\u00a0\u00a0I am also coming out of the shadows to share with you all my Authentic self: Who I am; What I believe in; and Where I hope progress, conviction and the current of life takes us all.\u00a0 I do these things not out of ego, but because to not do so would create a duality - a duplicity - that I don't want to live in, or with - a Stonk me and an IRL me.  So, I must step back from my role here, to step forward to serve Apes with my Work going forward.\u00a0  \u00a0\n\n[I'll Drink to That](https://preview.redd.it/dtbkkh8j7h471.png?width=974&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff99e91d499663cd149bf12a6d716cebcbf7b03c)\n\n# Fuck the FUD. Thank you, Mods.\n\nAfter this week's concerted FUD campaign against Mods I wanted to take a moment to peel back the\u00a0curtain and let you know what it's like to be a Mod at SuperStonk.\u00a0 First, the work Mods do for this sub is intense and what we face, literally, seems beyond sane at times.  The bizarre, shifting, divisive and calculated FUD campaigns are never ending. The stakes are high. Everyone's emotions are on edge.\u00a0 With this backdrop, Mods serve Apes tirelessly day in and day out to do justice to the\u00a0faith this Community puts in them. \n\nMost Mod work is unseen by design and therefor by structure and definition it is thankless work. And though they are and must be public\u00a0figures at times, they remain modest as best possible. Mods know they are not \"other than\", they are Apes first, Mods second.  It's a core value and shared ideal of all Mods.  But Mods' work and unique commitment\u00a0to this sub and community should be recognized, respected and appreciated for what it is - dedicated and selfless.\u00a0 So thank a Mod today, and tomorrow, and be patient with them everyday.  They work FOR you, and for your\u00a0families, and your dreams. \u00a0\n\n[A difficult choice.](https://preview.redd.it/yxoja9jn7h471.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=68aaa5f9ba8e7721fb17bcff81b7c255414dd791)\n\nAs one of a handful of moderators here at SuperStonk on that first fateful Sunday, I watched this Community grow from 1 to 100,000 in 24 hours, and grow to, as I'm writing this, 420,069+ members. (Coincidently, on[ 4/20 my Karma hit 69,420](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mv3mrv/nfw_i_sign_off_for_a_few_hours_and_come_back_to/) *Simulation* *Double* *Confirmed* \ud83e\udd2f)  But over these many short days, and endlessly long months, this Community has grown not only in numbers but in resolve, strength, intelligence, integrity and in common bond.\u00a0 \n\nSuperStonk, by the luck of circumstance and by the hard work of design, has become a sub-reddit unlike any before it.  A Community like no other.  It is veritable and virtual city of Athens - where Ideas reign and Ideals bond.  Mods and Apes at SuperStonk are guided by shared beliefs of individual empowerment, education, information, creativity and mutual respect.  And a pursuit of prosperity.  Simply put: We just like the stock, and each other.  These foundational Ideas and Ideals give this Community its unique strength. And they are the result of the promise of seeds planted in those early days, having now matured into this shrewdness of evolved, global, and diverse Apes. **You**. \u00a0\n\nI helped recruit and build this Mod team, and I am comfortable stepping back in part because I know that those at this sub's helm -\u00a0u/pinkcatsonacid, u/bye_triangle, u/redchessqueen99 and u/rensole,\u00a0and every moderator -\u00a0have the True North of Valhalla in their sights and Apes\u2019 best interests in their hearts.\u00a0 With this truly world class team, Apes are well served and protected.\n\n[ Hang a right at the second shitpost - and head straight on 'til morning.](https://preview.redd.it/ld4u1nzs7h471.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&s=633d2f8c8a567efe66d3065181cb1c911b1bc25d)\n\n# Two Steps Forward: First, into the Light\n\nStepping back from my Mod role was not an easy decision to make, but it was the right one for me ... so that I can take two steps forward.\u00a0 First into the light, and then into the fight.  By submitting my\u00a0hiatus notice weeks ago, and by now resigning my Mod\u00a0role at SuperStonk, I am free to\u00a0help advance the Ape's interests in other ways that more directly pull upon my personal and professional experience, without the veil and clumsy cloak of anonymity. \n\nI admire the bravery and courage of those willing to step forward into the light to fight, luminaries like [Dr. Trimbath (forever Queen Kong)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n1bles/new_link_for_dr_trimbath_ama/), u/dlauer, [Wes Christian](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nfs6s2/rsuperstonk_live_wes_christian_may_18_2021_watch/), Lucy Komisar and [Carl Hagberg](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nb36ig/thats_an_injustice_in_itself_that_were_letting/), and moderators like u/atobitt, u/pinkcatsonacid, u/jsmar19, u/sharkbaitlol and others.  \n\nAnd despite the concerns, and potential real-world consequences, I am unafraid.\u00a0I'm leaning in.\n\nI am [unafraid of trolls and shills](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lj699j/to_the_paid_shrills_and_pimps_i_hope_you_checked/); I fed shills to baby Satori to help it grow. I am unafraid of hedgies; I\u2019ve looked them in the eyes and seen their sins, and there are many.\u00a0\u00a0And - most of all - [I am unafraid of the truth](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcxhzd/lets_get_something_clear_sharing_a_wellfounded/); truth is knowledge, and knowledge is power. So I embrace the truth to lean\u00a0into this fight for equity in markets, structural and systemic fairness, and EQUAL ACCESS to information. So, here is who I am, and my path to this moment - this is my truth. \n\n[Existential. I have a very particular set of skills ...](https://preview.redd.it/svbnqi108h471.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&s=edce389b53b6c151a1bff14d85e94c67a14ddc87)\n\n# Never Forget Where You Come From\n\nFirst, and above all, I am a husband and father to three brilliant little girls, and I care deeply about my family's future.  My values were shaped by my parents, two NYC public school teachers, and through their\u00a0experiences and eyes I long witnessed the inequities of the educational system.  My grandparents were immigrants, short-haul truck drivers, and struggling business owners.  They toiled within debt systems that doomed them to a life of indentured poverty.  I know that I am fortunate, because of their struggle and sacrifice I had a precious and rare opportunity to reach up and grab - to seize - the American Dream. And I did not waste my chance.\u00a0 Diamond Fucking Hands.\n\nMy path to professional success was not paved by connections or wealth, but built upon a deep and foundational reservoir of focus, industriousness and creativity.  My path went from from community college to the Ivy League.  From staff to professional.  From follower to founder.  Along the way I have been a Humanitarian - delivering food and medicine in Belarus to child victims of the Chernobyl nuclear accident.  I have been a high school biology Teacher in the Bronx - witnessing the inequities of education first hand.  I have been a Lawyer at a top global firm, first as a peon underlying and then - through sheer force of will - winning a seat at tables of influence no young professional can imagine, nor expect.  And - now - I have been a SuperStonk Mod, during an unprecedented global Intellectual Rebellion.\n\n[The Power of APEs. The Power of People.](https://preview.redd.it/i70w63znih471.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=a62d2a03639b6689ccea5cce42b9c02bd379a03e)\n\nAt the peak of my legal career I left.  I recognized that I had lost sight of my humanitarian values and my charitable roots but, thankfully, not my memory of them.  So I cast off from the calm and comfort of being a working professional and entered the choppy and uncharted waters of social entrepreneurship.  I wanted to build the world I hoped for my daughters.  I wanted to align my passion and purpose.  So - with much work - I did.\n\nShortly after I left the law I founded a tech startup named TwentyTables. TwentyTables\u2019 mission was to tackle food insecurity head on, by designing new, tech-enabled, synergistic, vertically integrated systems that could provide low-cost high-quality meals *en mas*.\u00a0\u00a0TwentyTables provided affordable food to those who often couldn\u2019t access it, and donated meals to those who couldn\u2019t afford it.\u00a0\u00a0Over the ensuing 4 years, TwentyTables employed 20 amazing people, served hundreds of thousands of meals, and helped feed tens of thousands of hungry and homeless.  All bootstrapped without corporate funding.\n\n[ Just take a moment to ponder the fantastical implications.](https://preview.redd.it/zgcs7dh28h471.png?width=974&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d16d1ac1c6b20ace2fa46b5bc66531f4f855c9c)\n\nTwentyTables succeeded by building systems predicated on aligned incentives and by embedding structural dynamics where all prospered together. [\\*Somewhat like Dr. T's - unique - audiobook contract. Shout out to u/pinkcatsonacid!!\\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n71vy9/apes_change_the_world_superstonk_is_donating_time/) From investor, to food distributor, to vendor, to paying customer, to charity, to food insecure family, Everyones' incentives were aligned to make the system pull in the same direction.  TwentyTables was a tech enabled business whose foundations comprised complementary aims and goals, not ones based on predatory practices.  THIS is the way.  This is how you make difficult - systemic - change REAL.  And it works.\u00a0\n\nAlong the way, TwentyTables received national awards and recognition for our work, but I more often think about the people I met, the smiles I shared, and the bellies we filled.\u00a0 I know we had a real and lasting impact.  And with TwentyTables I learned just how powerful an Idea aligning profit and purpose was - truly capitalism in its best form.\u00a0 And I learned that the Idea resonated at local food banks,\u00a0and in ivy halls.\u00a0 The Idea of aligned Prosperity was Universal, and Powerful.\n\n[US Chamber of Commerce Foundation Citizen Awards: Best Corporate Steward \\(Sm\\/Md\\) \\(2020\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xoa7zygv8h471.jpg?width=2771&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cafc1c6303a928141a3a001acb277c3f95c72881)\n\nBut then, COVID hit and ... like so many other growing businesses ... COVID killed my company, scattered my employees, and faded the once shining - perhaps grandiose - vision I had of building a better, more efficient, more equitable food system. And gone was the vision for a better world I was building for my little girls.\u00a0 COVID ultimately took not only my company, but for many months it took away my purpose.  The good I had dedicated my life to bringing into this world was gone. It was a dark and isolated time for me.\u00a0 And but for the shining beacon of my family\u2019s love - and my dog's constant and unconditional companionship - I was a deeply lost individual.\u00a0\n\n**Lost.** [Until I found you, all.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbd8nt/gme_roll_call_part_deux_are_you_hodling_raise/) **Damn, I love you Apes.**\n\n[Buy, HODL, Buckle Up!

So, I bought shares out of solidarity - 10 shares that first day - and my diamond\u00a0hands formed fast. [That\u00a0first week was brutal. Buy moar, HODL - this is the way](https://www.reddit.com/user/StonkU2/comments/ldeab4/committed_to_the_stonk_gme_week_one_so_yeah_it/) \\- and so I did, all the way down to that fateful Feb. 19 - when u/deepfuckingvalue doubled down.\u00a0 [GME launched off of $38.50, so, as compelled to, I began buying on the way up too](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lm3x2n/in_short_i_like_the_stock_dfv_same/). And, you know what I did yesterday ... bought the diiiiiip ... at a tasty $212.   I stand before you today a proud XXX holder.  It's modest to some, and much to others.  Perspective is everything.\n\nMy roots on Reddit are humble. I lurked mostly and followed Apes during the First Great Migration\u00a0\u00a0- from r/wallstreetbets to r/GME \\- and then built a platform to - ultimately - [help direct apes here during the Second Great Migration](https://www.reddit.com/r/MOASS/comments/mk82u8/apes_you_are_here_because_of_what_you_see/) \\- from r/GME to r/Superstonk. Because of my help that first day, Red invited me to join her here and to build this sub from the ground up, and to create a system and team that best serves Apes.\u00a0 And that's what we did.\n\nI believe this persistent - obstinate - apish drive towards truth, transparency, fairness, and community - and the global drum beat of systemic reform - is without historical parallel.  I believe this is an Intellectual Rebellion waged by Apes against the status quo, fought in an age of ubiquitous but not universal Information, and where access to that knowledge\u00a0makes all the difference.\u00a0 For when Ideas and Data are the Slings and Arrows in the war for Change and\u00a0Prosperity, [Truth is both the ultimate Shield and Sword.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mxhcnq/beware_phishing_scams_are_trying_to_steal_your/) \u00a0\n\n[Truth, knowledge, data, transparency, equity, community.](https://preview.redd.it/xdwelxh49h471.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=003b175b3b11a90b5419010d5e1b7dfda4f0bb2a)\n\nI am stepping back from my Moderator role today, but not away from this Community and I am not abandoning Apes - [not after coming all this way with you](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwdsmm/after_1_week_of_voting_5_brackets_128_submissions/) \\- but I'm stepping back because I believe I can serve you best going forward in the open, in a new\u00a0capacity that I hope to soon share.\u00a0 **But for this new role the veil of anonymity is cumbersome, and so today I stand in front of you all - exposed - prepared for your judgment, hoping to be recognized for the Ape that I am and the good person I aspire to be.

Sitting quietly with your computer, your phone, and your ideas, you have done ... all this.  But we are just getting started.  So I caution that the information that gives birth to and fosters these Ideas, these needed truths for an Intellectual Rebellion, is fiercely guarded and intentionally opaque. And if Ideas are Power, their accumulation - Knowledge - is prosperity. **I believe: To truly achieve fairness, equity, and equality in the markets, the walls surrounding Knowledge, Data, Community and Collaboration must come down - the playing field must be leveled broadly so that as Apes and All people may thrive.**  \n\n\n[Sunshine is the Best Antiseptic.](https://preview.redd.it/iopoq76s9h471.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=80f431a86d90020ee41ea06c4291429962400b18)\n\n**A reckoning of markets is coming,\u00a0catalyzed by individuals united in ideology and global in reach.**\u00a0 Lessons born from this moment will be taught for decades shared both by friends around firepits, and lecturers in ivy halls.

        "Title": "SLV is a complete scam, its a scalp trade set up by banks to screw over investors. Avoid it at all costs. The silver market is and has been rigged for years",
        "Body/Content": " WSB was never moving into silver. The media got the story wrong.\n\nThink about who reads weekend financial news. Old people. The last time silver had a real short squeeze was in the 70s, and these people are now in their 70s. Who clicks on ads? Basically only old people. Dealers of gold and silver love to advertise, and media likes to make money through click-through revenue. Of course they are going to post all these stories of small unit silver selling out at dealers, they will get higher click through and sales kickbacks from the targeted ads on these articles.\n\nIf you are purchasing SLV thinking you are purchasing silver on the open market, you could not be more wrong. **Purchasing SLV is the best way for an investor to shoot themselves directly in the face.**\n\nI have done some research on SLV and I have come to believe that it is essentially a vehicle for JPM and other banks to crush retail investors by manipulating the silver market.\n\nSo what are these games of manipulation that the banks have played?\n\n**The general theme could be described as this: If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall.**\n\nJeff Currie from Goldman had an interview on February 4th where he dismissed the idea of a silver short squeeze, and he had one line that was especially profound,\n\n\u201cIn terms of thinking how are you going to create a squeeze, the shorts are the ETFs, the ETFs buy the physical, they turn around and sell on the COMEX.\u201d \u2013 Jeff Currie of Goldman\n\nThis was shocking to holders of SLV, because SLV is a long-only silver ETF. They simply buy silver as inflows occur and keep that silver in a vault. They have no price risk, if the price of silver declines, it\u2019s the investors who lose money, not the ETF itself, so there is no need to hedge by shorting on the COMEX. Further, their prospectus prohibits them from participating in the futures market at all. So how is the ETF shorting silver?\n\nThey aren\u2019t. The iShares SLV ETF is not shorting silver, its custodian, JP Morgan is shorting silver. This is what Jeff Currie meant when he said the shorts are the ETFs. Moreover, he said it with a tone like this fact should be plainly obvious to all of the dumb retail investors. He truly meant what he said.\n\nWhat is a custodian you ask? The custodian of the ETF is the entity that actually buys, sells, and stores the silver. All iShares does is market the ETF and collect the fees. When money comes in they notify their custodian and their custodian sends them an updated list of silver bars that are allocated to the ETF.\n\nBut no real open market purchases of silver are occurring. Instead, JPM (and a few sub custodian banks) accumulated a large amount of silver, segmented it off into LBMA vaults, and simply trade back and forth with the ETFs as they receive inflows. **Thus, ensuring that ETF inflows never actually impact the true open market trade of silver.** When the SLV receives inflows, JPM sells silver from the segmented off vaults, and then proceeds to short silver on the futures exchange. As the price drops, silver investors become disheartened and sell their SLV, thus selling the silver back to JPM at a lower price. It\u2019s a continuous scalp trade that nets JPM and the banks billions in profits. Here\u2019s a diagram to help you sort it out:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[reduce, reuse, recycle](https://preview.redd.it/ewkug02chwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=a424d1a61b93e9a37541cdf8ff19591a3df9fb88)\n\nAn even more clear admission that SLV doesn\u2019t impact the real silver market came on February 3rd when it changed its prospectus to state that it might not be possible to acquire additional silver in the near future. What does this even mean? Why would it not be possible to acquire additional silver? As long as the ETF is willing to pay a higher price, more silver will be available to purchase. But if the ETF doesn\u2019t participate in the real silver market, that\u2019s actually not the case. What SLV was admitting here, was that the silver in the JPM segmented off vaults might run out, and that they refuse to bid up the price of silver in the open market. They will not purchase additional silver to accommodate inflows, beyond what JPM will allow them to.\n\nThe real issue here is that purchasing SLV doesn\u2019t actually impact the market price of silver one bit. The price is determined completely separately on the futures exchange. SLV doesn\u2019t purchase futures contracts and then take delivery of silver, it just uses JPM as a custodian who allocates more silver to their vault from an existing, controlled supply. This is an extremely strange phenomenon in markets, and its unnatural.\n\nFor example, when millions of people buy GME stock, it puts a direct bid under the price of the stock, causing the price to rise.\n\nWhen millions of people put money into the USO oil ETF, that fund then purchases oil futures contracts directly, which puts a bid under the price of oil.\n\nBut when millions of people buy SLV, it does nothing at all to directly impact the price of silver. The price of silver is determined separately, and SLV is completely in the position of price taker.\n\nSo how do we know banks like JPM are shorting on the futures market whenever SLV experiences inflows? Well luckily for us the CFTC publishes the \u2018bank participation report\u2019 which shows exactly how banks are positioned on the futures market.\n\nThe chart below shows SLV YoY change in shares outstanding which are evidence of inflows and outflows to the ETF. The orange line is the net short position of all banks participating in the silver futures market. The series runs from April-2007 through February-2021. I use a 12M trailing avg of the banks\u2019 net position to smooth out the awkward lumpiness caused by the fact that futures have 5 primary delivery months per year, and this causes cyclicality in the level of open interest depending on time of year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2vpm42uehwo61.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=5feb48c0ce3ce1a2a55280e7ec2f79b8b7f33c0a\n\nIt is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions. What\u2019s also evident is that the short interest of the banks has grown over time, which is also why silver is ripe for a potential short squeeze, just not by using SLV.\n\nOne other thing that is evident, is that the trend of banks shorting when SLV receives inflows, is starting to break down. Specifically, beginning in the summer of 2020, as deliveries began to surge, the net short interest among banks has actually declined as SLV has experienced inflows. It\u2019s likely one or more banks see the risk, and the writing on the wall and is trying to exit before a potential squeeze happens (having seen what happened with GME).\n\nFor further evidence of this theme of, \u201cIf banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall\u201d look no further than the deliveries data itself,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6gnlo7ghwo61.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb6ff867907a4de54a27876835cad96ac00ad46e\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that as long as futures investors didn\u2019t actually want the silver to be delivered, the price of silver was allowed to rise, but whenever deliveries showed an uptick, the price would begin to fall once again. This is because the shorts know that they can decrease the price of all silver in the world by shorting on the COMEX, and then secure real physical silver from primary dealers to actually make delivery. Why pay a higher price to the dealers when you can simply add to shorts on the COMEX and push the price down, and then acquire the silver you need?\n\nBut just like the graph of the bank net short position, you\u2019ll notice that this relationship started to break down in 2020, and the price has started to rise alongside deliveries. The short squeeze is underway, and the dam is about to break.\n\nAnd lest you think I\u2019m reaching with my accusations of price manipulation by JPM, why not just listen to what the department of Justice concluded?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fwjolfmhhwo61.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b1804172cace87c2fb285f1f13bad1d5dcef374\n\nFor JPM and the banks involved in the silver market, fines from regulators are just a cost of doing business. The only way to get banks to stop manipulating precious metals markets is to call the bluff, take delivery, and make them feel the losses of their short position.\n\nSLV is by far the largest silver ETF in the world, with 600 million ounces of silver under its control, and its custodian was labeled a criminal enterprise for manipulation of silver markets. Why should silver investors ever put their money into a silver ETF where the entity that controls the silver is actively working against them, or at a minimum is a criminal enterprise?\n\nAnd let me know if you see a trend in the custodial vaults of the other popular silver ETFs:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8kbb08xihwo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=7da347b06b44433082ab041d11f35d1563c8919a\n\nFurther exacerbating the lack of trust one should have in these ETFs, is the fact that they store the metal at the LBMA in London. Unlike the COMEX that has regular independent audits, the LBMA isn\u2019t required to have independent audits, nor do independent audits occur. I\u2019m not saying the silver isn\u2019t there, but why not allow independent auditors in to provide more confidence?\n\nSo what are investors to do in a rigged game like this?\n\nWell, there is currently one ETF that is outside this system, and which actually purchases silver on the open market as it receives inflows. That ETF is PSLV, from Sprott. Founded by Eric Sprott, a billionaire precious metals investor with a stake in nearly ever silver mine in the world, so you know his interests are aligned with the longs of the PSLV ETF (in desiring higher prices for silver via real price discovery). Further, PSLV buys its silver directly, it doesn\u2019t have a separate entity doing the purchasing, it stores its silver at the Royal Canadian Mint rather than the LBMA, and it is independently audited. By purchasing the PSLV ETF, retail investors can actually acquire 1000oz bars and put a bid under the price of silver in the primary dealer marketplace. And if a premium occurs among primary dealers, deliveries will occur in the futures market.\n\nThis is what is starting to happen right now, a premium has developed among primary dealers, and deliveries on the COMEX have started to surge, while COMEX inventories have begun to decline. And this is happening after PSLV has added just 30 million ounces over 7 weeks (once the small contingent of silver squeezers realized SLV was a scam and started switching). Imagine what will happen if investors create 100 million ounces of demand.\n\nEven a small portion of SLV investors switching to PSLV because **they realize the custodian of SLV is a criminal enterprise**, would create a massive groundswell of demand in the real physical silver market.\n\nAfter the original silver squeeze posts went viral on WSB on 1/27, silver rose massively over the first 3 trading days following it. But on 1/31 a post was made about citadel being long SLV which got 74k upvotes (compared to only 15k on the original silver post). This lead to a fizzling in the momentum for the silver squeeze movement on WSB. However, given what I've explained here about how SLV is a complete scam meant to screw over investors, is it really that much of a surprise?\n\nAdditionally, that post about citadel showed them with $130m in SLV. That's only 0.04% of Citadel's AUM. Do you really think they were pushing silver because 0.04% of their AUM was in SLV? This post also didn't detail the fact that citadel also had short positions on SLV. That's what a market maker does. They have long and short positions in just about everything.\n\nThere are plenty of banks talking about a commodities super cycle, and a \u2018green\u2019 commodity super cycle where they upgrade metals like copper, but they never mention silver. Likely because banks have a massive net short position in silver.\n\nLets dig into the potential for a silver squeeze, starting with the silver market itself.\n\nSilver is priced in the futures market, and its price is based on 1000oz commercial bars. A futures market allows buyers and sellers of a commodity to come to agreement on a price for a specific amount of that commodity at a specific date in the future. Most buyers in the futures market are speculators rather than entities who actually want to take delivery of the commodity. So once their contract date nears, they close out their contracts and \u2018roll\u2019 them over to a future date. Historically, only a tiny percentage of the longs take delivery, but the existence of this ability to take delivery is what gives these markets their legitimacy. If the right to take delivery didn\u2019t exist, then the market wouldn\u2019t be a true market for silver. Delivery is what keeps the price anchored to reality.\n\nIndustrial players and large-scale investors who want to acquire large amounts of physical silver don\u2019t typically do it through the futures market. They instead use primary dealers who operate outside of the futures market, because taking delivery of futures is actually a massive pain in the ass. They only do it if they really have to. Deliveries only surge in the futures market when supply is so tight that silver from the primary dealers starts to be priced at a large premium to the futures price, thus incentivizing taking delivery. Despite setting the index price for the entire silver market, the futures exchange is really more of a supplier of last resort than a main player in the physical market.\n\nMost shorts (the sellers) in the futures market also source their silver from sources outside of exchange warehouses for the occasional times they are called to deliver. The COMEX has an inventory of \u2018registered\u2019 silver that is effectively a big pile of silver that exists as a last resort source to meet delivery demand if supply ever gets very tight. But even as deliveries are made each month, you will typically see next to no movement among the registered silver because silver is still available to source from primary dealers.\n\nSo how have deliveries and registered ounces been trending recently?\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at the first quarter deliveries in 2021 compared to the first quarter in previous years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u6vl4z3lhwo61.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=97d96e5ee4fcc5553bb267603f764a0378123dec\n\nAfter adding in the 3.6 million ounces of open interest remaining in the current March contract (anyone holding this late in the month is taking delivery), 1Q 2021 would reach 78 million ounces delivered. This is a massive increase relative to previous years, and also an all-time record for Q1 from the data that I can find.\n\nEven more stark, is the chart showing deliveries on a 12-month trailing basis (which I also showed earlier)\n\nNote: You have to view this on an annual basis because the futures market has 5 main delivery months and 7 less active months, so using a shorter time frame would involve cutting out an unequal share of the 5 primary months depending on what time of year it is.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o4wjuwfmhwo61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=03f45022e0f2d1702d5c3e0aaa2877a654ed884b\n\nAs you can see from the chart, starting in the month of April 2020, deliveries have gone completely parabolic. While silver doesn\u2019t need deliveries to spike for a rally to occur, a spike in deliveries is the primary ingredient for a short squeeze. The 2001-2011 rally didn\u2019t involve a short squeeze for example, so it \u2018only\u2019 caused silver to rise 10x. In the 2020s however, we have a fundamentals-based rally that is running headlong into a surge in deliveries that is extremely close to triggering a short squeeze.\n\nIn fact this is visible when looking at the chart of inventories at the COMEX.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9907dfnnhwo61.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=45d5859b4c8cd42a66118d62e6d1a97f2364d774\n\nAs you can see from the graph and the chart above, COMEX inventories are beginning to decline at a rapid pace. To explain a bit further, the \u2018eligible\u2019 category of COMEX is silver that has moved from registered status to delivered. It is called \u2018eligible\u2019 because even though the ownership of the silver has transferred to the entity who requested delivery, they haven\u2019t taken it out of the warehouse. It is technically eligible become \u2018registered\u2019 if the owner decided to sell it. However, the fact that it is in the eligible category means that it would likely require higher silver prices for the owner to decide to sell.\n\nThe current path of silver in the futures market is that registered ounces are being delivered, they then become eligible, and entities are actually taking their eligible stocks out of COMEX warehouses and into the real physical world. This is a sign that the futures market is currently the silver supplier of last resort. And there are only 127 million ounces left in the registered category. 1/3 of an ounce, or roughly $10 worth of silver is left in the supply of last resort for every American. If just 1% of Americans purchased $1,000 worth of the PSLV ETF, it would be equivalent to 127 million ounces of silver, the entire registered inventory of the COMEX. That\u2019s how tight this market is.\n\nRight now we are sending most Americans a $1,400 check. If 1% of them converted it to silver through PSLV, this market could truly explode higher.\n\nAnd lest you think this surge in deliveries is going to stop any time soon, just take a look at how the April contract\u2019s open interest is trending at a record high level:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/olei0ejphwo61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=e53aa870cf012bdeff94fb0b9f4d07ab8127813f\n\nIt looks almost unreal. And keep in mind the other high points in this chart were records unto themselves. That light brown line was February 2021, and look how its deliveries compared to previous years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/llu9bzoqhwo61.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd538ecd2ad375f52aa20ae9932d3b795832f322\n\n12 million ounces were delivered in the month of February 2021. A month that is not a primary delivery month, and which exceeded previous year\u2019s February totals by a multiple of 4x. Open interest for February peaked at 8 million ounces, which means that an additional 4 million ounces were opened and delivered within the delivery window itself.\n\nApril\u2019s open interest is currently at a level of 15 million ounces and rising. If it followed a similar pattern to February of intra-month deliveries being added, it could potentially see deliveries of over 20 million ounces. 20 million ounces in a non-active month would be completely unheard of and is more than most primary delivery months used to see.\n\nHere\u2019s what 20 million ounces delivered in April would look like compared to previous years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n706c9yrhwo61.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=78c23017586291a4f7efc66a274c8f1c9a99b4f3\n\nSo just how tenuous is the situation that the shorts have put themselves in (yes CFTC, the shorts did this to themselves)? Well let\u2019s look at the next active delivery month of May:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ppuloa0thwo61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=680a8cfba0f920b008a6660f52f35d45d82557db\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fkh2bdfxhwo61.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=86c2bf46c9b547b8e0b0cfe109639ad283a832e7\n\nIf a larger percentage than usual take delivery in May, there is easily enough open interest to cause a true run on silver. With 127 million ounces in the registered category, and 652 million ounces in the money, most of it from futures rather than options, the short interest as a % of the float is roughly 513%. Its simply a matter of whether the longs decide to call the bluff of the shorts.\n\nNo long contract holder wants to be left holding the last contract when the COMEX declares \u2018force majeure\u2019 and defaults on its delivery obligations. This means that they will be settled in cash rather than silver, and won\u2019t get to participate in the further upside of the move right when its likely going parabolic. As registered inventories dwindle, longs are incentivized to take physical delivery just so that they can guarantee they will be able to remain long silver.\n\nOf course, the COMEX could always prevent a default by simply allowing silver to continue trading higher. There is always silver available if the price is high enough. Like the situation with GameStop, the authorities have historically tended to interfere with the silver market during previous short squeezes where longs begin to take delivery in large quantities.\n\nThere were always shares of GME available to purchase, it\u2019s just that the price had not reached what the longs were demanding quite yet. Given that it was the powerful connected elite of society who were short GME though, the trade was shut down and rigged against the millions of retail traders. The GME short squeeze may indeed continue, because in this situation it\u2019s millions of small individuals holding GME. While they were able to temporarily prevent purchases of GME, they can\u2019t force them to sell.\n\nIn the silver short squeeze of the 1970s, that\u2019s exactly what the authorities forced the Hunt Brothers (the duo that orchestrated the squeeze) to do, they actually forced them to sell. The difference this time is that it\u2019s not a squeeze orchestrated by a single entity, but rather millions of individuals who are purchasing a few ounces of silver each from around the globe. There is no collusion on the long side among a small group of actors like in the 70s with the Hunt brothers or when Warren Buffet squeezed silver in the late 90s, so there\u2019s no basis to stop the squeeze.\n\nIn the squeeze of 1979-1980, the regulators literally pulled a \u2018GameStop\u2019 on the silver market. Or in reality, the more recent action with GameStop was regulators pulling a \u2018silver\u2019. The regulators will try everything in their power to prevent the squeeze from happening again, but this time it\u2019s not two brothers and a couple of Saudi princes buying millions of ounces each (or just Warren Buffet on his own), but rather it\u2019s millions of retail investors buying a few ounces each. There is no cornering the market going on. This is actual silver demand running headlong into a silver market that banks have irresponsibly shorted to such a level that they deserve the losses that hit them. They\u2019ve been manipulating and toying with silver investors for decades and profiting off of illegal collusion. Bailing out the banks as their losses pile up would be truly reprehensible action by our government, and tacit admission that our government is ok with a few big banks on the short side stealing billions from small individual investors.\n\nBut what about beyond a short squeeze? Is there any logic to buying silver on a fundamentals basis?\n\nThere are two types of bull markets in silver. One is a fundamentals-based bull market, where silver is undervalued relative to industrial and monetary demand. The second type of silver bull market is a short squeeze. Both types of bull markets have occurred at different points in the past 60 years. However, the 1971-80 market in which the price of silver increased over 30x does was combination of both types of bull markets.\n\nI believe we may be entering another silver bull market like the one that began in the fall of 1971, where both a short squeeze and fundamentals-based rally occur simultaneously.\n\nSmoke alarms are ringing in the silver market, and are signaling another generational bull market.\n\nSo what are these \u2018smoke alarms\u2019?\n\nI recently went digging through various data to try and quantify where we are in the silver bull/bear market cycle.\n\nI ended up creating an indicator that I like to call SMOEC, pronounced \u2018smoke\u2019.\n\nThe components of the abbreviation come from the words Silver, Money supply, and Economy.\n\nLets look at the money supply relative to the economy, or GDP. More specifically, if you look at the chart below, you will see the ratio of M3 Money supply to nominal GDP, monthly, from 1960 through 2020.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ltu4vgovhwo61.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=de4f9f2f0748ca3d86e8cf153175efa78901435d\n\nWhen this ratio is rising, it means that the broad money supply (M3) is increasing faster than the economy, and when it is falling it means that the economy is growing faster than the money supply.\n\nOne thing that is very important when investing in any asset class, is the valuation that you enter the market at. Silver is no different, but being a commodity rather than cash-flow producing asset, how does one value silver? It might not produce cash flows or pay dividends, but it does have a long history of being used as both money and as a monetary hedge, so this is the correct lense through which to examine the \u2018valuation\u2019 level of silver.\n\nEnter the SMOEC indicator. The SMOEC indicator tells you when silver is generationally undervalued and sets off a \u2018smoke alarm\u2019 that is the signal to start buying. In other words, SMOEC is a signal telling you when silver is about to smoke it up and get super high.\n\nBelow, you will see a chart of the SMOEC indicator. SMOEC is calculated by dividing the monthly price of silver by the ratio shown above (M3/GDP).\n\nMore specifically it is: LN(Silver Price / (M3/Nominal GDP))\n\nBelow you will see a chart of the SMOEC level from January 1965 through March 2021.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5m8y7kzyhwo61.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=1073a6fa09e9b1151a162b79172d673af515fc93\n\nI want to bring your attention to the blue long-term trendline for SMOEC, and how it can be used to help indicate when investing in silver is likely a good idea. Essentially, when growth in money supply is faster than growth of the economy, AND silver has been underinvested in as an asset class long enough, the SMOEC alarm is triggered as it hits this blue line.\n\nSince 1965, SMOEC has only touched this trendline three times.\n\nThe first occurrence was in October 1971, where SMOEC bottomed at 0.79 and proceeded to increase 3.41 points over the next eight years to peak at 4.20 in February of 1980 (literally 420, I told you it was a sign silver was about to get high). Silver rose from $1.31 to $36.13, or a 2,658% gain using the end of month values (the daily close trough to peak was even greater). Over this same period, the S&P 500 returned only 67% with dividends reinvested. Silver, a metal with no cash flows, outperformed equities by a multiple of 40x over this period of 8.5 years (neither return is adjusted for inflation). This is partially due to the fact that the Hunt Brothers took delivery of so many contracts that it caused a short squeeze on top of the fundamentals-based rally.\n\nThe second time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was when SMOEC dropped to a ratio of 2.10 in November of 2001 and proceeded to increase 2.32 points over the next decade to peak at 4.42 in April of 2011. Silver rose from $4.14 to $48.60, an increase of over 1000%, and this was during a \u2018lost decade\u2019 for equities. The S&P 500 with dividends reinvested, returned only 41% in this 9.5-year period. Silver outperformed equities by a multiple of 24x (neither figure adjusted for inflation). There was no short squeeze involved in this bull market.\n\nOver the long term, it would be expected that cash flow producing assets would outperform silver, but over specific 8-10 year periods of time, silver can outperform other asset classes by many multiples. And in a true hyperinflationary environment where currency collapse is occurring, silver drastically outperforms. Just look at the Venezuelan stock market during their recent currency collapse. Investors received gains in the millions of percentage points, but in real terms (inflation adjusted) they actually lost 94%. This is an example of a situation where silver would be a far better asset to own than equities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ir5gcfv0iwo61.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e02b95d63beea8de9b7e067cc40655d7a59da16\n\nI in no way think this is coming to the United States. I do think inflation will rise, and the value of the dollar will fall, but it will be nothing even close to a currency collapse. Fortunately for silver investors, a currency collapse isn\u2019t necessary for silver to outperform equity returns by over 10x during the next decade.\n\nBack to SMOEC though:\n\nThe third time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was very recently in April of 2020 when it hit a level of 2.91. Silver was priced at $14.96, at a time the money supply was and still is increasing at a historically high rate, combined with the previous decade\u2019s massive underinvestment in Silver (coming off of the 2011 highs). Starting in April 2020, silver has since risen to a SMOEC level of 3.37 as of March 2021. Silver is 0.46 points into a rally that I think could mirror the 1970s and push silver\u2019s SMOEC level up by over 3.4 points once again.\n\nRemember that this indicator is on a LN scale, where each point is actually an exponential increase in the price of silver. Here is a chart to help you mentally digest what the price of silver would be at various SMOEC level and M3/GDP combinations. (LN scale because silver is nature\u2019s money, so it just felt right)\n\nThe yellow highlighted box is where silver was in April of 2020 and the blue highlighted box is close to where it is as of March 2021.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/af5yjg13iwo61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=f34ac3ae181c742c4ab2dbf30f64ae82648d84ac\n\n**An increase of 3.4 points from the bottom in in April of 2020 would mean a silver price of over $500 an ounce before this decade is out. And there\u2019s really no reason it must stop there.**\n\nThe recent money supply growth has been extreme, and as the US government continues to implement modern monetary policy with massive debt driven deficits, it is expected that monetary expansion will continue. This is why bonds and have been selling off recently, and why yields are soaring. Long term treasuries just experienced their first bear market since 1980 (a drop of 20% or more). The 40-year bull market bond streak just ended. What was the situation like the last time bonds had a bear market? Massively higher inflation and precious metals prices.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0e9ncqp4iwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=21a08435c70609ca534ca672815cc2095358ef5a\n\nThis inflation expectation is showing up in surging breakeven inflation rates. And this trend is showing very little sign of letting up, just look at the 5-year expected inflation rate:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/esd1tzp5iwo61.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c26a1673a48f884c3e3cba23ef3d393cfc5eac9\n\nInflation expectations are rising because we are actually starting to put money into the hands of real people rather than simply adding to bank reserves through QE. Stimulus checks, higher unemployment benefits, child tax credit expansion, PPP grants, deferral of loan payments, and likely some outright debt forgiveness soon as well. Whether or not you agree with these programs is irrelevant. They are not funded by increased taxes, they are funded through debt and money creation financed by the fed. As structural unemployment remains high (low unemployment is a fed mandate), I don\u2019t see these programs letting up, and in fact I would be betting that further social safety net expansion is on the way. The $1.9 trillion bill was just passed, and it\u2019s rumored the upcoming \u2018infrastructure\u2019 bill is going to be between $3-4 trillion.\n\nThis is the trap that the fed finds itself in. Inflation expectations are pushing yields higher, but the nation\u2019s debt levels (public and private) have expanded so much that raising rates would crush the nation fiscally through higher interest payments. Raising rates would also likely increase unemployment in the short run, during a time that unemployment is already high. So they won\u2019t raise rates to stop inflation because the costs of doing so are more unpalatable than the inflation itself. They will keep short term rates at 0%, and begin to implement yield curve control where they put a cap on long term yields (as was done in the 1940s, the only other time debt levels were this high). So where does the air come out of this bubble, if the fed can\u2019t raise rates at a time of expanding inflation? The value of the dollar. We will see a much lower dollar in terms of the goods it can buy, and likely in terms of other currencies as well (depending on how much money creation they perform).\n\nThe other problem with the fed\u2019s policy of keeping rates low for extended durations of time (like has been the case since 2008), is that it actually breeds higher structural unemployment. In the short term, unemployment is impacted by interest rate shifts, but in the longer-term lower interest rates decrease the number of jobs available. Every company would like to fire as many people as possible to cut costs, and when they brag about creating jobs, know that the decision was never about jobs, but rather that jobs are a byproduct of expansion and are used as a bargaining chip to secure favorable tax credits and subsidies. Recently, the best way to get rid of workers is through automation.\n\nRobotics and AI are advancing rapidly and can increasingly be used to completely replace workers. The debate every company has is whether its worth paying a worker $40k every year or buying a robot that costs $200k up front and $5k a year to do that job. The reason they would buy the robot is because after so many years, there comes a point where the company will have saved money by doing so, because it is only paying $5k a year in up-keep versus $40k a year in salary and benefits. The cost of buying the robot is that it likely requires financing to pay that high of a price up front. In this situation, at 10% interest rates, the breakeven point for buying the robot versus employing a human is roughly 8 years. At 2% interest rates though, the breakeven investment timeline for purchasing the robot is only 4 years.\n\nThe business environment is uncertain, and deciding to purchase a robot with the thought that it will pay off starting 8 years from now is much riskier than making a decision that will pay off starting only 4 years from now. This trade off between employing people versus robots and AI is only becoming clearer too. Inflation puts natural upward pressure on wages, governments are mandating higher minimum wages are costlier benefits as well. There\u2019s also the rising cost of healthcare that employers provide as well. Meanwhile the costs of robotics and AI are plummeting. The equation is tipped evermore towards capital versus labor, and the fed exacerbates this trend by ensuring the cost of capital is as low as possible via low interest rates.\n\nOn top of the automation trend, low interest rates drive mergers and acquisitions which also drive higher structural unemployment. In an industry with 3 competitors, the trend for the last 40 years has been for one massive corporation to simply purchase its competitor and fire half the workers (you don\u2019t need 2 accounting departments after all). How can one $50 billion corporation afford to borrow $45 billion to purchase its massive competitor? Because long term low interest rates allow it to borrow the money in a way that the interest payments are affordable. Lacking competitive pressures, the industry now stagnates in terms of innovation which hurts long term growth in both wages and employment. Of course, our absolutely spineless anti-trust enforcement is partially to blame for this issue as well.\n\nThe fed is keeping interest rates low over long periods of time to help fix unemployment, when in reality low interest rates exacerbate unemployment and income inequality (execs get higher pay when they do layoffs and when they acquire competitors). **The fed\u2019s solution to the problem is contributing to making the problem larger, and they\u2019ll keep giving us more of the solution until the problem is fixed.** And as structural unemployment continues, universal basic income and other social safety net policies will expand, funded by debt. Excess debt then further encourages the fed to keep interest rates low, because who wants to cut off benefits to people in need? And then low long term interest rates create more unemployment and more need for the safety nets. It\u2019s a vicious cycle, but one that is extremely positive for the price of precious metals, especially silver.\n\nAnd guess what expensive robotics, electric vehicles, satellites, rockets, medical imaging tech, solar panels, and a bevy of other fast-growing technologies utilize as an input? Silver. Silver\u2019s industrial demand is driven by the fact that compared to other elements it is the best conductor of electricity, its highly reflective, and it extremely durable. So, encouraging more capital investment in these industries via green government mandates and via low interest rates only drives demand for silver further.\n\nOne might wonder how with high unemployment we can actually get inflation. Well government is more than replacing lost income so far, just take a look at how disposable income has trended during this time of high unemployment. It\u2019s also notable that all of the political momentum is in the direction of increasing incomes through government programs even further.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mnfd5gr7iwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=34c7b3ddfc9808b29e08bd7619d47d1f51f840fc\n\nThe spark of inflation is what ignites rallies in precious metals like silver, and these rallies typically extend far beyond what the inflation rates would justify on their own. This is because precious metals are insurance against fiat collapse. People don\u2019t worry about fiat insurance when inflation is low, but when inflation rises it becomes very relevant at a time that there isn\u2019t much capacity to satisfy the surge in demand for this insurance. Sure, inflation might only peak at 5% or 10% and while silver rises 100%, but if things spiral out of control its worth paying for silver even after a big rally, because the equities you hold aren\u2019t going to be worth much in real terms if the wheels truly came off the wagon. The Venezuela example proves that fact, but even during the 1970s equities had negative real rates of return and the US never had hyperinflation, just high inflation.\n\nDuring these times of higher inflation, holders of PMs aren\u2019t necessarily expecting a fiat collapse, they just want 1%, 5%, or even 10% of their portfolio to be allocated to holding gold and silver as a hedge. During the 40-year bond bull market of decreasing inflation this portfolio allocation to precious metals lost favor, and virtually no one has it any longer. I can guarantee most people don\u2019t even have the options of buying gold or silver in their 401ks, let alone actually owning any. A move back into having even a small precious metals allocation is what drives silver up by 30x or more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: SLV is a scam, as are basically all of the silver ETFs.**\n\nIf you do want to buy silver you'll buy physical when premiums are low, or PSLV.\n\nDisclaimer: I am a random guy on the internet and this entire post should be regarded as my personal opinion",

        "Title": "Holy shit. I was skeptical of all the high ceilings being thrown out until I put the pieces together. I honestly think GME is priceless, and the most valuable stock you will ever buy. Here's the full picture, as I understand it...",
        "Body/Content": "First of all, I\u2019d like to start off by stating this post is completely nonpartisan. GME is not a political debate, it\u2019s a class war.\n\nOkay, let me ask you guys this \u2014 how many of you knew that when the pandemic began, the FED pumped $3 trillion dollars into the markets? I watch the news in the background all day, every day, and I didn\u2019t know at the time when the injections were happening. This news would have been of great interest to me since I day trade, so it would not be something that I wasn\u2019t paying attention to. I just simply wasn\u2019t looking in the right places.\n\nYou may not have been aware of the pump either because they were discreet. MSM that isn't financial news never mentioned them. And we were even misled about it. How many times did you hear Trump brag that markets being at an all-time high? This literally had nothing to do with how well the economy was doing. Or the markets for that matter. The record high is completely artificial.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a political issue; this is a class issue. What should infuriate you most is that people were literally starving, unable to pay their rent, and job losses were reaching record highs, while our government withheld aid to desperate Americans, and even took a vacation in the middle of their debate about it. But the Federal Reserve wasted no time (in March 2020) spending trillions of dollars bailing out banks. Again.\n\nIt was not to protect your retirement accounts. They claimed there was not enough liquidity in the markets, and Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell stated he will do whatever it takes to prevent another Great Depression. But their actions are what is about to cause the next potential Great Depression.\n\nNot only was $3 trillion pumped into the market, but the Federal Reserve also lent an additional $1 trillion a day to large banks for 14-days. None of that was taxpayer money, by the way. The FED was just printing money. They loaned TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to big banks, while the U.S. Government told the American people they didn\u2019t even deserve a $600 check of their own, taxpayer money.\n\nThe banks, investment firms, and hedge funds got too greedy and pumped too much into the market ([Here\u2019s what the s&amp;amp;amp;p currently looks like if you haven't seen this image](https://imgur.com/AV3OIrs)), and the SEC and the DTCC were complicit. Now, there\u2019s too much liquidity. There is more borrowed money than real cash in the market and it has no real value. It\u2019s a house of cards, ready to fall at any moment. The wheels are in motion. It is happening. Correction is imminent.\n\nThe SEC realized the market bubble at least 6 months ago. You may have heard that big banks recently had huge record-setting sales last week on bonds and were taking advantage of a recent dip in Treasury yields. That was a lie. The SEC told brokers that as of April 22nd, they must have the capital to cover every share they borrowed from investors and lent out to hedge funds. So, banks needed billions of extra capital on hand by April 22nd or they would have had to recall shares.\n\nI personally believe that the crash has begun and has been in motion since early February. I wrote [a post about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/munkug/the_market_collapse_has_already_begun_and_has/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;context=3) yesterday, after realizing the trends for every stock on my watchlist have been extremely unusual. I received hundreds of comments from people saying they\u2019re noticing the same unusual trend.\n\nThe crash isn\u2019t obvious to the average person because the stock market has continued to report record highs, every week. However, my trading strategy focuses entirely on penny stocks that are owned by hedge funds known to manipulate the market. Most stocks I invest in are all complete garbage, but I look for pump and dumps, obvious manipulation patterns, and anticipate runners based on near-identical charts of multiple companies. So, none of the stocks on my watchlists are in any of the benchmark indexes like the s&amp;amp;amp;p 500, Nasdaq, and the Dow.\n\nIn one of the most interesting comments, [Comotron](https://www.reddit.com/user/Comotron/) explains it perfectly: \"High-momentum stocks, which are risky at any time of the market cycle, are particularly so in the weeks prior to a bull market top. There could be a 'smaller dip first, followed by another rise for a few months and finally a much larger correction that officially ends the bull cycle. That\u2019s the conclusion I reached upon analyzing all U.S. bull markets since 1926. Stocks that are riding a wave of momentum do not crest in unison with the broad market averages. They instead start to lose steam several weeks in advance. It is probably fair to say that \"penny stocks\" fall into the \"high-momentum stocks\" category. Either way, based on historical data, there appear to be credible indicators that suggest a market correction might happen in the near future.\u201d\n\nThat information is **fucking. fascinating.** From early December to mid-January, the market was ridiculously bullish. I literally made more money in one month than my annual salary. Then all of a sudden, every single one of my stocks just started trending downward, had a short rise, and have continued to bleed for the past few weeks. All of them. Exactly the same time. And exactly like he said in the comment.\n\nThere has definitely already been a mass sell-off of securities by hedge funds who have lost AT LEAST 70 billion dollars in the past quarter, because of the tremendously dangerous and reckless risks they\u2019ve taken recently, which alone would have crashed the market without the pump from the Federal Reserve. As we know, the hedge funds knew it would too, but gambled with our money anyway. This is just the beginning. There is a domino effect of bankruptcies on the way for hedge funds.\n\nWe know the media has recently reported that investment banks and hedge funds had record-breaking quarters recently. Which, technically they did. But that\u2019s because losses are only reported when you sell. They have not covered any of the short positions yet and are paying millions of dollars every single day until they do. In fact, capital from the mass sell-off isn\u2019t going towards paying off their debt, millions of dollars are going towards suppressing this information, manipulating the market for more capital, and reducing losses. What they\u2019re doing is completely illegal and the media is not reporting it, the left or the right-wing media. It\u2019s because they\u2019re all controlled by billionaires. In the past three months, I have never seen so much lying and corruption in my life.\n\nAs the SEC\u2019s deadline to secure capital approaches there have been other signs that things are going to blow up very soon. For instance:\n\n* The SEC announced in a press release that it will award a record-breaking $114 million to whistleblowers whose information and assistance lead to the successful enforcement of SEC and related actions.\n* Gary Gensler was confirmed as the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday. He was sworn on Saturday. What\u2019s interesting about that is that it\u2019s not typical to be sworn in on Saturdays. The last SEC chairman to be sworn in on a Saturday was George Bradford Cook, and it was before the Watergate scandal broke.\n\nWhen all this does break, they will try to change the narrative. They\u2019re going to blame it on retail traders and say overvalued stocks bought during the pandemic caused the crash. Fox will probably even blame the Biden administration. But either way, they\u2019ve already started pushing an alternative narrative. For example, CNN linked an interview with some dude (I really don\u2019t care enough to look for his name or the video, because I don\u2019t find him credible) who owns a market intelligence company. The guy apparently predicted every single market crash since 1987\u2019s Black Monday. I watched the whole interview, and he went on and on about how there will be a market crash soon and said the reason is that tech stocks are overvalued right now. If he were an actual market expert explaining the upcoming market bubble, he would have mentioned any of the information above, but he didn\u2019t. He strictly talked about tech stocks.\n\nSo, yeah, it\u2019s out there. Billionaires control the stock market, media, and our politicians.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you guys, but I\u2019m fucking sick of it. And for that, they need to pay.\n\n**The Ceiling/Floor:**\n\nThere are many factors in all this that we need to calculate into our ceiling/floor. First of all, we should demand back the $17 trillion dollar bailout given to banks, that was gambled away recklessly, and will inevitably crash our economy.\n\n$17 trillion / 55.6 million (float) = $303,571.00/share\n\nThat would be my floor if there was no market bubble. But there is. And it\u2019s their fault. Therefore, our floor should hold them accountable for the massive amount of money Americans are about to lose when the market crashes. The only problem (for hedge funds) is that no one knows how much this is going to cost.\n\nFor that reason, I believe GME is priceless. They can't afford to keep the price down, once the squeeze begins. We literally choose the price. The limit does not exist.\n\nI believed it before, but I see it now. And I have all the information, which makes me believe we are owed this money. Not just for past for corruption, but to cover future, unavoidable losses.\n\nI ask you all to stop fighting about the floor and ceiling, take down your sell limits, and repeat after me:\n\n**\u201cMy shares are not for sale.\u201d**\n\nStop thinking about selling. I will remind you again that we own the float. They\u2019re paying millions of dollars in interest each day and will eventually be forced to cover. Force the liquidity to dry up. Watch buy orders rise from $1,000, $5,000, $10,000\u2026$1,000,000\u2026because they\u2019re not being filled.\n\nSell when you feel comfortable and believe it\u2019s an amount you deserve. Everyone has different risk tolerances, not everyone will sell at the same time, and we know the original members of r/wallstreetbets have an extremely and unusually high tolerance for risk. So, trust us and each other.\n\nThis really is a revolution. As Scaramucci Tweeted, this is like the modern-day French Revolution of finance. Gamestop is a MOTHERFUCKING (Keith) GILL-OTINE.\n\nThis is the way.\n\n[Trust me. Everything is going to be fine.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbWHZwD5rGQ&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ab_channel=FlashReborn)\n\nEdit: Since this hit r/all, I thought I would mention that I am a female because WSBs has gotten a lot of criticism about it being a \"boys' club\". It isn't.\n\nEdit 2: Yo, Mr. Gensler - FOR SOME REASON, Jay Clayton and the mainstream media were unable to figure most of this information out. (I know, crazy!) So, will I be receiving my $114 million whistleblower check in the mail...or...? Also, Jay Clayton might not be aware he's out of a job yet. You guys may want to let him know. Not on top of things, that one.",

        "Title": "[Discussion] ACTION to SAVE NET NEUTRALITY and the WORLD's LARGEST MUSIC LIBRARY!",
        "Body/Content": "EDIT: This is very long. So, no, you don't have to read the whole thing if you are not part of our movement, #mala.\n\nThis is reference tool for you to use when fighting to save net neutrality.\n\n**MAIN PROBLEM**\n\nNot enough people are making enough noise about net neutrality.\n\n**WTF? WHY?**\n \nPeople can't get motivated about net neutrality if they don't know what to do.\n\n**MAIN PROBLEMS with NET NEUTRALITY**\n* **Intro:** These are the problems that I have noticed with the net neutrality movement.\n \n* **Disorganized**: There are several different voices shouting everywhere at once. People are confused on what to do.\n\n* **Contradicting Messages**: There are contradicting messages about net neutrality. Believe or not, there are people who don't understand what net neutrality is **who are against it.** There's too much misinformation about this (*should be*) simple subject.\n\n* **Confusion:** The contradicting messages about net neutrality have people confused. People don't want to feel confused.\n\n* **Naivety/Blind Hope:** People don't want to feel hopeless about life. Net neutrality seems to be one of those subjects that seem way too complicated. They are trying to feel as happy as they can - if they know it's pointless because it's **an emotional defense mechanism.**\n\n\n* **Circlejerking:** Most net neutrality supporters tend to spend most of their time where other net neutrality supporters are. They're not reaching out to people who desperately need to hear their message.\n\n\n* **Low Morale:** Most net neutrality supporters (and the Internet citizenry as a whole) feel defeated. They don't know about Senators who support net neutrality or the those who have went from being neutral to being in support.\n\n\n* **Perception:** The only people I have heard talking about net neutrality are Millennial kids. Older Americans (if they disliked Trump). Net neutrality is seen too much as a liberal thing, **and not a free speech** thing.\n\n\n* **Infiltrated/Corrupted YouTubers:** Some YouTubers and Internet celebrities (such as Ezra Klein and Casey Neistat) have been corrupted with their media presence being sold to media companies owned by the ISP's. Their call-to-action is to call the FCC, **an agency currently known for dodging, ignoring, and even lying**, and instead of using leverage in order to pressure the FCC to stop. They are misleading that potential energy into a wasted effort.\n\n\n* **Tech Companies Not Pushing Hard Enough:** Facebook, Google, and Netflix are not pushing hard enough for net neutrality like they used to. The people on their social media platforms (especially Instagram) are pushing net neutrality on a minute-by-minute basis but the company isn't taking a stance on the issue.\n\n\n* **Little Coverage from 'Clean' YouTubers:** YouTubers, the ones who drive (and make a living from) controversy are not talking about net neutrality. \n\n**ASSETS that WE DO HAVE**\n\n*We've discussed the problems. Let's discussed the tools that we do have on our side. Yes, we have the greatest human invention and that comes with some assets. :)*\n \n* **Online businesses:** Online business, by design, has a direct incentive, in having the least amount of overhead and the most amount of customer reach. No net neutrality means that customer reach is **severely limited**. Mention this to online businesses in getting their support in letting their audience know about net neutrality.\n \n* **Instagram**: There are businesses on Instagram that want net neutrality to stay. You can send these businesses a message about net neutrality.\n\n**Basic Human Psychology**: **The most important thing that you must know: Humans use emotions FIRST and justify with logic SECOND. GO for the EMOTIONAL first.** Net neutrality is already straightforward. \n\t\n* **Use anger/fear to motivate**: If people are comfortable, they don't move. Use anger to get people uncomfortable. You can spark anger by presenting Ajit Pai as the enemy and the Internet as the child. *Motivate people with anger to protect the Internet as the child that is danger.* \n\n\n* **Use humor to create relaxation**: Net neutrality is a stressful. Use humor to get people interested in net neutrality by making it funny. People need to laugh. Too much negative emotion can repel people.\n\n\n* **Use short messages (less than 6 words in a slogan)**: Use short messages that are easy to remember and unable to counteract against. A great example: **\"Net neutrality is ONLINE FREE SPEECH.\"**\n\n\n* **Avoid depression phase**: People get depressed because they feel fucked over and they feel that they have no options. Don't let your viewer or your audience hit that depression phase. You have to immediately show the call-to-action/[Battle for the Net](https://battleforthenet.com)\n\n**Vast Array of Talents:** The Internet is a vast place. We all have some sort of talent.\n \n* **Art:** You can draw a webcomic and share it like crazy on social media platforms. Seriously, share it. Share it everywhere: Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.\n\n\n* **Infographics**: Any business professionals out here? I need you to make some Infographics and showcase how the net neutrality repeal can harm their business marketing efforts.\n\n\n* **Memes:** You can't draw? Make memes. Make a lot of memes. Spread those memes everywhere on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube (to get some robot YouTuber to read it).\n\n\n* **Music:** Make a song about net neutrality and upload it to Soundcloud. Share it everywhere on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, to your favorite content creators that they can use.\n\n\n* **Humor:** Do people laugh with or at you? Who cares, either way. Get them laughing about net neutrality and motivate them to **call their Senator and their Representative.**\n\n\n* **Comedy:** Use comedy skits to your advantage to convince people in order to get them to understand the FFC vote. Make sure that your call-to-action is getting people to call their Senators and their Representative.\n\n\n* **Lowbrow:** Use the lowbrow humor. An example: \"I wanted to fap to Pornhub but I need a porn package from AT&T. (**DON'T LET AT&T TELL WHO YOU CAN FAP TO. CALL YOUR SENATOR and YOUR REP TODAY!**)\n\n\n* **Stir Up Controversy:** For people who did extensive research on this subject only, find a Libertarian/anti-net neutrality opponent with an audience and challenge them to a **public** debate about net neutrality.\n\n\n* **Storytelling:** Are you great with writing stories. Write a story, team up with an artist or an animator so that people can visually understand that what you are telling them.\n\n\n* **Sex Appeal:** Are you sexy as hell? Are you a BBW cam model? Well, use your sexy body to get people interested in saving net neutrality. Give a free cam show to those who called their Senators and their Representative. Yes, **SEX APPEAL** is an **ASS**et.\n\n**Everyone Has A Direct Interest in Preserving The Internet:** The greatest human invention where we can see Mars at any time and even allows us to fap whenever we want. Everyone in the USA has a stake in keeping the Internet open and free.\n \n* **Everyone Hates Their ISP**: Comcast is famous for this. They charge people **AFTER** they cancel their service. Use this as an opportunity to convince to take revenge against their ISP's by calling their Senator and their Representative to enact them to do something.\n\n\n* **People Against Net Neutrality**: These people also want the same thing as you. It's worse to see that but it's true. They are just misinformed. For these people, use well-citied evidence that they can't refute. Also, use Pai's lies to fuel your explanation. (**Yes, Pai is on your side...I will explain later.**)\n\n**Ajit Pai:** This gorgeous bastard is going to help us save the Internet. That's right, he's an asset. Tired of fighting an uphill battle: **We can leverage Ajit Pai against himself. ** \n \n* **He's An Enemy:** He's Public Enemy #1 of the Internet - and he deserves it, too. So, how do we make him work for us.\n\n* **He's Smug:** We can use his smugness against him. We can show that Mean Tweets video of him to direct them to going to [BattlefortheNet.com.](https://battleforthenet.com)\n\n\n\n* **He's Got That Mean Tweets Video:** If I was ever running against him in an election, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBt84HNAGwU) would be a godsend. We can use that video, put simple messages on it, and share it like crazy on Facebook. **The most important part would be that we convert people into calling their Senators and their Representatives via https://battleforthenet.co. Spread this video around while memeing it up saying, \"THIS GUY WANTS TO CHARGE YOU FOR EVERY SITE YOU GO TO\". \"DON'T LET HIM! CALL YOUR SENATOR and YOUR REP\". [This video, believe it or not, is a godsend! We can use this video against Ajit Pai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBt84HNAGwU) **so spread this video around Facebook relentlessly while captions to direct people to [Battle for the Net](https://battleforthenet.com).\n\n\n* **We Can Bring Down His Plan with His Own Undoing:** Ajit is literally giving us the ammunition that we need to strike his plan. We can make **fun, easy-to-read Infographics** to compare his plan to how reality works.\n\n\n* **ONE IMPORTANT NOTE: AJIT WANTS US TO HATE HIM. IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE DIRECT THAT ANGER AT HIM INTO STRIKING HIM WHERE IT HURTS: HIS PROPOSAL. DIRECT THE ANGER INTO CALLING SENATORS and REPRESENTATIVES on BATTLEFORTHENET.com.**\n\n\n* **Holy shit, his constant lying record**: He is constantly lying. Regardless of the FCC vote, our Senators and Representatives are going to need a constant record of his lies and the truths that are opposed to his plan. Send your Senators and Representatives. Also, use Infographics to publish on Linkedin so that people can see the Infographics and fully understand why Pai is lying his ass off.\n\n\n* **His past**: **He's a ex-Verizon lawyer working in an agency that is supposed to police **Verizon**. A great explanation for why this is wrong would be: **\"A crackhead in charge of the DEA\"**; **\"Micheal Vick running PETA\"**; **\"A pedophile running an elementary school.\"**\n\n\n* **Avoid Using Trump as The Enemy:** Bear in mind that half of the country voted for Trump. \n\n**These are the people that we have to reach.** We don't need Trump to be the enemy; Ajit Pai is just fine **and ten times better** as our enemy and he has all the smugness, treacherous history, lies, and hate against him to get people upset and ready to move.\n\n\n**Social Media**: We have social media and private messaging apps. We can reach our friends and family more intimately than any news media ever can.\n \n* **Facebook**: Use videos and add banners to them or add subtitles to the video. Videos on Facebook spread faster. Be sure to upload videos directly to Facebook so that it can spread faster on the social media. Direct people in the video (or if you are using someone else's video: the description under video) to [Battle For The Net](https://battleforthenet.com). Keep description short and straight to the point.\n\n* **Instagram:** Use pictures on Instagram. Use 15 second videos to tell people why net neutrality important to the Internet. Use the picture to direct people to go to [Battle For The Net](https://battleforthenet.com)\n\n\n* **Twitter:** Take whatever content that you have created in order to have it spread it further. With Twitter, you will have to spread it farther and repeatedly. Have the content spread with the hashtags #netneutrality; #stoptheFCC; #breaktheinternet\n\n\n* **Gab.io:** I don't know much about this social media platform but you can focus on posting there. The more outside you guys are, the better.\n\n\n* **4chan**: 4chan likes to try experiments in getting themselves noticed. Post about net neutrality. Don't push the issue but invite them to help.\n\n\n* **Other Subreddits:** Create a relevant topics that can also relate to subreddit that you are in.\n\n\n* **Minds.io:** Get people to discuss their opinions on Minds.io and get them interested in spreading the news about net neutrality in a way that is educated.\n\n\n* **YouTube:** Create videos about YouTube. [This person did a great job at making the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLGMp8x3rA4&t=6s) **Don't forget to spread your videos to everyone on multiple social media platforms, multiple times throughout the day.**\n\n\n\n**Short Meme Videos**: The shorter the message, the farther the message. **This is why I continue to express: **NET NEUTRALITY IS ONLINE FREE SPEECH.**\n\n\n \n* Even if you are shitty video creator, you can still make meme videos. You can easily make a meme.\n\n\n* Even if you still feel that you can't make a meme, you can still spread funny memes all over the Internet.\n\n\n* You can use funny videos to get people to go to [Battle for The Net](https://battleforthenet.com)\n\n **Memes**: Memes are great because you can say what you want to say to your audience in a short amount of time.\n \n* **Humor**: You can use memes to make people laugh. \"Do you want your websites to be blocked? Then FUCK NET NEUTRALITY!\" Humor gets people interested.\n\n\n* **Educated:** You can use memes to educate people quickly - use less than 10 words and use specific examples. For example: \"Title II prevents Comcast from gouging you.\"\n\n\n* **Combat Misinformation**: If you have been hearing misinformation about Title II, you can use memes to combat that. **\"Net neutrality lets Facebook and Google control the Internet. People can choose to not use Facebook and Google.\"**\n\n\n* **Action-Engaging**: You can use messages like, \"Don't let Ajit Pai destroy the Internet. Go call your Senator and your Representative\".\n\n* **The Expedient Nature of the Internet**: The Internet makes really fast. This is one advantage that Internet has over everything.\n\n\n* **Our Smartphones**: People have their smartphones. They carry them whereever they go. We can easily reach people where they are.\n\n\n* **Sense of Action**: The action required to do what is very small but once people know about what Ajit Pai has done, make the action they have to do be relatively small.\n\n\n* **We Can Speak To Our Audience, News Media Can't**: We can 24/7 access to their audience. We can reach out to them and even answer their questions about net neutrality.\n\n\n* **Our Reach Is Stronger Than The News Media**: We know our circle of friends and family more closely. Mention it in passing.\n\n\n* **Other Net Neutrality Videos**: Other people have been made better videos. [This one is a good example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtt2aSV8wdw).  [So is this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggasfCOmQK8).  [And so is this one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bd27PgNJNIo) Don't have time to make your net neutrality video, **just a good one, especially the ones already listed here.\n\n\n* **Senators and Representatives:** Senators want to keep their job. Some Senators are decent people and other are corrupt. You can convince the corrupt Senators and Reps to change their minds by reminding them that they are not going to keep their job when elections are coming. Some of these guys sold for $500. **Also, for the Senators and Representatives who are fighting the good fight for you, give them a call and thank them.** It's a thankless job. :)\n\n\n* **Most Importantly, Use BATTLEfortheNET.com as CALL-TO-ACTION in all Your ACTION**: Get people, especially in the Red States, to call their Senators and their Representatives about Title II oversight in the link that has the description in it by having them go to [Battle For The Net.](https://battleforthenet.com)\n\n**SOLUTIONS**: So what can we do about this.?\n \n* **Organized Movement**: I am creating an organized movement to educate and convert people into saving net neutrality called #mala. Perhaps, you can create a movement of your own.\n\n* **One, Short, Straightforward Messages**: Use short messages that are straight to the point. They spread farther and they are easier to be remember.\n\n\n* **Keep The Messages Short**: I can't stress this enough. The shorter the messages, the simple language the better. Use 4th-grade English when you are creating your memes and your videos. (**[No, they are not stupid where they can can't understand anything but shorter messages spread faster. This action plan is written in 4th-grade English as a good example to use. If you are still confused, use this.](http://gunning-fog-index.com/))\n\n\n* **Get The 'Normies' Angry and Direct That Anger To Take Action**: Get outside of your circle of friends who are tech-savvy already. Talk to people who are not always online all the time, too or more interested in mainstream news. Keep the conversation simple, **\"Would you pay more for the same Internet\"**\n\n\n* **Get The 'Normies' Associated:** Only tech-savvy people seem to be freaking out about this. We need to drive a larger controversy where normal people have to contact the \"normies\" in their lives about the Internet.\n\n\n* **Understand that the News Had Ignored Us Before**: The mainstream news is compromised by the ISP's. You have to spread the news in our playground: the Internet. We know the social media platforms like the back of our hand. We can abuse the spread of news about net neutrality.\n\n\n* **Get The News To Fight Us, FAST:** Using controversy is the best way to make this happen. I am aware that Ajit Pai is the pawn but driving focus to his actions is the key to getting some controversy. He has plenty of reasons to go about, too.\n\n\n* **Partner Up with Social Media 'Microphones:** Leverage the voices with those who have larger audiences than you. Their words will reach more people than yours ever could. Contact YouTubers, podcasters, social media personalities about net neutrality and how it affects them.\n\n\n* **Contact Businesses To Do Surprise Sales, Program for Net Neutrality**: Business have stake in having unlimited customer reach and not having to deal with unpredictable overhead.\n\n\n* **Contact YouTubers to Talk About Net Neutrality**: Contact YouTubers about net neutrality and ask them to do a video about net neutrality. **Be sure to have your sources ready so that they can easily talk about the net neutrality.**\n\n\n* **THE ONLY CTA is Calling Senators and Representatives**: The most important thing is getting people to call their Senators and their Representatives right away. This is the only action that needs to be taken.\n\n__________________________________\n\n**TOO LONG/DIDN'T READ**: This is the (somewhat) short version. I do want the whole thing to be read but if you could, you can read just this and read few sections at a time.\n\n**SUGGESTED TACTICS**\n \n* **Use branded content **(mainstream shows/movies that everyone watches)** to bring awareness:** Use branded mainstream media content that everyone already knows as memes or videos. They spread faster and they get people excited about net neutrality. Make sure that you use that meme to direct people to [Battle For The Net.](https://battleforthenet.com)\n\n\n* **Abuse Ajit Pai's Mean Tweets video:** Create a short meme video where you can upload on Facebook. Use white banner bars over this video about Ajit Pai doing a Mean Tweets video. **Top BANNER: \"AJIT PAI WANTS TO MAKE YOU PAY MORE FOR THE INTERNET\" BOTTOM BANNER: \"DON'T LET HIM! CALL YOUR SENATORS and YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.**\n\n\n* **Most importantly, use CTA in messages: Call Senate and Representatives**: The most thing about to stress out is to use media to convert your audience into going to [Battle for the Net.](https://battleforthenet.com) This is very important. The conversion drives the traffic to the right Senators and the Representatives.\n\n\n* **Bring relevance to net neutrality in a creative way:**  Use popular media like **The Office, The Simpsons, Final Fantasy VII, Super Mario Bros., and other **POPULAR MEDIA** to spread the message across the social media networks.\n\n\n* **Use short facts about FFC and net neutrality. Use 4th grade-level English.** Keep the language simple and straight-to-the-point. There is a reason why Ajit Pai keeps saying, \"Take the Internet out of the hands of bueracrats and into entrepreneurs and engineers. Our sound bite is \"**NET NEUTRALITY IS FREE SPEECH**\". It's simple, proven, and hard to debate against.\n\n\n* **Use humor, entertainment, suspense, sex appeal to get people intrigued and interesting.** People are busy so using net neutrality in a way gets people excited and funny. **What if you are talentless?** Share another video if someone who is talented! [This video is a great example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JucFpDhuF98)\n\n\n* **Contact businesses and content creators**: Businesses and content creators have interest in keeping net neutrality alive. You can contact them about net neutrality and make the research phase the most easiest phase when you compile the evidence that they need to look through. **Bonus points if you can summarize each source you give to them.**\n\n\n* **Educate yourself**: Understand the history behind ISP's. It's a confusing history but you have to do your research so you can explain to the next person why you think net neutrality is proven.\n\n\n* **To maximize spread, upload your content in the early morning**: I have been testing this out to some great results. Keep uploading (and re-uploading the same content) in the early morning. I don't know why exactly but it spreads faster this way.\n\n**ACTION PLAN:**\n \n* **Put down the Shotgun, Use Your Rifle**: It's time to stay aiming at anything that moves and being reactive. We need to be proactive. Calling Senators and Representatives do help but we need to aim our rifles at the general public. Get them to call their Senators and their Representatives.\n\n\n* **Aim at the Right Targets**: The right targets are getting the average person motivated to call the Senators and their Representatives.\n\n\n* **Use the Call-to-Action To Leverage Against the FCC**: The only action that we ask our audience to do is to contact their Senators and their Representatives. [Battle For The Net](https://battleforthenet.com)\n\n\n* **Use Researchers who Know Everything about Net Neutrality**: Team up with researchers who understand net neutrality thoroughly! Use them as a reference to understand all about net neutrality.\n\n\n* **Spark Some Controversy**: It's still key that we get on the news about this. Spread Ajit Pai about net neutrality. Not everyone knows how important net neutrality is to them. So, reaching out beyond just our circles is **critical**.\n\n\n* **Use Condensed Messages**: Keep your messages engaging, short, straight-to-the-point when speaking about net neutrality.\n\n\n* **Use Mainstream Media**: Use **Breaking Bad, Mad Men, Mr. Robot, Big Bang Theory, The Simpsons, Futurama, Star Wars, Parks and Recreation, Spongebob Squarepants**,  and other **POPULAR** media to spread your messages about net neutrality. It spreads faster and farther. **ALWAYS put the call-to-action in there.** Always, always direct people into calling their Senators and their Representative - especially if they are Republican.\n\n* **LEVERAGE AJIT PAI AGAINST HIMSELF**: The best way that you convert the bystander to your side is to convince them that Ajit Pai hates America and currently lying to the American people now. [This Mean Tweets video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBt84HNAGwU) should do the trick. \n\n* **Pictures and Videos Spread More**: Use pictures and short videos to spread news about net neutrality.\n\n**READ THE BLUEPRINT AS A GUIDELINE:**\n\n* [I have  also written a blueprint on how to **BEST GO ABOUT THIS**.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepOurNetFree/comments/7hffx7/blueprint_to_save_net_neutrality/)\n\nEDIT: Whoever just gave me GOLD, thank you. This is the second time this has ever happened to me, 2 times in this weekend. :)\n\n2nd EDIT: I have been glided twice. Thank you, stranger. :)\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**TL;DR:** [I finally organized a movement to save Internet free speech!

        "Body/Content": "*Welcome new viewers to Superstonk!  Hope this hits* r/all.

Please note if you consider investing \u2013 due to inferred market manipulation, this stock should currently be treated as a speculative investment, and you will need to do your own due diligence to decide whether this stock is appropriate for you. GameStop\u2019s stock can exhibit extreme price volatility, but I am of the personal belief that relative to other publicly traded stocks with similar characteristics, the fundamental valuation of this company should be much greater - *conservatively* $350 - $450 without manipulation and higher within the next few years as it moves towards it\u2019s e-commerce objectives (currently trading around $166.00). A great long term value investment.\n\nOn the upside, I also believe this stock has an opportunity for an ***historic*** squeeze! A once in any lifetime opportunity. Underpinning this it is believed that there has been mass market manipulation perpetrated. The following is information that I have put together to provide a snapshot of information leading to these beliefs. There is some great fact-based information and due diligence shared, along with some educated theoretical information.\n\nIf you are interested in making an informed decision around this stock you may want to delve into the information and resources provided below, and I would suggest (re)watching \u2018The Big Short\u2019 (2008 subprime crisis movie) and the documentary \u2018The Inside Job\u2019. These movies highlight, among other things, the corruption within our financial markets: market makers, bankers, and government officials. They also highlight shortcomings in market regulations and the huge issues surrounding our derivative markets \u2013 which has become exceedingly ominous leading into 2022. \\[[Wall Street\u2019s Naked Swindle](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/)\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lmh50tbldjr81.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=38ebdadaa5e247e458fd3fad17277fc2a6592e6b\n\n* Companies are generally shorted when it is believed that their stock price will fall (to be able to buy the stock back at a lower price), and high short activity is often associated with an attempt to short a company into bankruptcy. For GameStop, the market for physical game media went into a state of decline with the introduction of digital and downloadable games, and GameStop\u2019s directors at the time failed to respond to the changing landscape, GameStop's financials were deteriorating and noticeable shorting of Gamestop began escalating through 2017 to the 2020 Covid-19 period, in what appears to be an attempt to bankrupt the company. The company's shares would hit a record low of $2.80 in April 2020. However, as retail interest was piqued, there was a resounding belief that the company could turn itself around and speculation of a 'short squeeze'. The price of $GME appreciated and hit an all time high of $483.00 on January 28, 2021.\n* The Securities and Exchange Commission [report released October 14, 2021](https://www.sec.gov/files/staff-report-equity-options-market-struction-conditions-early-2021.pdf) supported that there was no short squeeze in January (price appreciation was the result of regular buying pressure), and that short positions were only marginally covering during the buying period Jan 19, 2021 to Feb 5, 2021. This has left market participants with extensive short positions in the position of having to cover in a raising $GME price environment at significant losses.\n* GameStop has approximately 76 million shares issued, yet had approximately 220% of it\u2019s tradeable float outstanding in January 2021 (FINRA short interest as declared in Robinhood court documents). The rule of thumb is that short interest as a percentage of float above 10% is pretty high and above 20% is extremely high. High short interest like this affirms that counterfeit shares have been created and exist illegally. Due diligence (DD) supports that the short interest has been manipulated and hidden through derivative strategies such as options, swaps, leaps and futures; and that the true short interest could now realistically be sitting higher than 300%.\n* Due diligence also illustrates how market participants are manipulating and attempting to control the price of GME through continued shorting, high frequency trading, controlling the media narrative, internalized trades, and other manipulative trading strategies. \\[Note: *None* of this DD has been debunked, and much of it is evidenced by previously documented official complaints to the SEC, along with reports from the SEC, citing similar strategies used in the past against other companies.\\]\n* GameStop\u2019s business\u2019 fundamentals have improved dramatically with net sales of $6.011 billion for fiscal year 2021, an 18% increase compared to $5.090 billion for fiscal year 2020. They have expanded their product catalog to include a broader set of consumer electronics, PC gaming equipment and refurbished hardware; made significant and long-term investments in the Company\u2019s fulfillment network, systems and teams; and have established new offices in Seattle Washington and Boston Massachusetts, which are technology hub talent markets.\n* Since the \u2018Sneeze Squeeze\u2019 in January 2021, e-commerce giants have sacrificed executive talent to GameStop, with [hundreds of talented executives](https://gmedd.com/transformation/gamestop-bags-chewy-vp-of-engineering/) leaving thriving tech companies like Chewie and Amazon for GameStop.  With Ryan Cohen as the new Chairman of the Board and a new [technology focused board of directors](https://news.gamestop.com/corporate-governance) (June 2021) GameStop now has a unified leadership fully committed to two long term goals: \u2018Delighting Customers & Delivering Value for Stockholders\u2019.  GameStop now have a balance sheet of around $1.27 billion in cash with virtually no debt.\n* GameStop is the largest video game retailer worldwide; They have undergone a radical strategic transformation, expanding their business model to compete and thrive in an era of mobile gaming and digital downloads, and have been busy reinventing themselves as a major ecommerce player. To date, GameStop has announced partnerships with Loopring and Immutable X, and GameStop's NFT Marketplace has been announced for launch by the end of Q2 2022.\n* The Marketplace will be powered by Loopring L2. GameStop, in partnership with Loopring, has the opportunity to cement itself at the forefront of this new paradigm and become the destination for global digital economies. Immutable X is the back end of GameStop's marketplace, helping create NFTs and to bring onboard hundreds or thousands of game studios using their $100 million joint fund to build on the new technology platform ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fne4XMhtVf4&t=235s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fne4XMhtVf4&t=235s)). This partnership outlines a 2 year milestone objective of $1.5 billion and $3.0 billion in combined primary sales and secondary market sales transactions within 24 months of launch.\n* Gamestop has a revolutionary, dedicated diehard shareholder base that is Direct Registering Shares (DRS) and exposing the manipulation of market makers and short hedge funds to the broader retail market. Current Short Interest and FTDs is over 24% (as publicly reported, excluding the hidden derivative based manipulation of additional SI & FTDs) , and the tradeable float is shrinking daily pushing borrowing costs higher and making it more expensive by the day for market participants to maintain their short positions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jykhg1kmdjr81.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=adb2b59caf8fafcdd3fa1476309de2e7f712a2cb\n\n# Summary\n\nGameStop has a huge advantage over startup tech-companies as it enters the ecommerce metaverse, \u2018quietly making their actions speak louder than words\u2019. With the footprint of 4,573 stores in 14 countries, and over 55 million PowerUp reward members within its ecosystem which can be leveraged for new revenue streams - as GameStop moves forward with its ecommerce and NFT marketplace the potential for this company rivals market giants like Amazon, Apple, and Meta (Facebook, Instagram etc). GameStop is not an ordinary stock, nor is it a failing brick-and-mortar retail chain like Wall Street previously thought. It is a very well financed, established growth company, with grand plans in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe current price of $GME is demonstrably manipulated and significantly undervalued.  ***Simply put - the price of $GME is wrong*** **- and will continue to be wrong until the manipulation of the stock is eradicated and the short positions are** ***closed*** **- not just** ***covered***. As short positions are forced to buy and close out their positions at the market 'ask' price, and in the event that retail owns the float and investors hold out on the sale of their shares we could have not just a \u2018Short Squeeze' - but the 'Mother of all Short Squeezes' (MOASS).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Part 2: Short positions were not closed. Short interest (SI) was reduced, failures to deliver (FTDs) were hidden, and price suppression was achieved - through manipulative derivative strategies.\n\n>Part 1.

Back in 2019, this figure was around $151.55 billion. Gaming industry stats show that the industry is forecast to grow at a rate of 9.17% from 2020 to 2025.  GameStop is exploring block-chain technologies, including an NFT marketplace, which could provide massive, untapped revenue streams. For example, OpenSea, which has a fraction of GameStop\u2019s customer / member-rewards base, was recently valued at over $10bn based on its NFT marketplace alone. GameStop will be a beneficiary of Loopring\u2019s revolutionary \u201cLayer 2 Rollup\u201d technology, which will greatly eliminate \u201cgas fees\u201d and reduce the cost of NFT transactions.\n\nFrom GameStop's posted job descriptions (four plus months ago):\n\n\"At GameStop, we want to transform the way millions of players gear-up to game by offering a wide-selection products at competitive prices at your fingertips. We are a Fortune 500 company with an omnichannel customer experience that spans digital ecommerce, 4,500+ retail stores globally, and we are in the middle of a digital transformation. We're at an inflection point...want to develop our own intellectual property and take this company in a direction that's driven by technology.\n\nGameStop is in the midst of a game-changing metamorphosis, transforming from old school into a modern company that is driven at its core by technology.

        "Title": "TIFU by missing the birth of my daughter",
        "Body/Content": "Happened yesterday at 2am. \n\nSo my wife was pregnant. I work from home in internet marketing so don\u2019t get out too too much, but she heard of a cool local tech conference and thought I should check it out. (Important detail to remember)\n\nThe conference was 2.5hrs away in a neighbouring city. \n\nAnyway.  She was 37 weeks pregnant (babies are typically cooked at 40), and has been feeling great so didn\u2019t see any issue with me being gone one night. Like, what are the chances?\n\nSo me and a friend packed up and left for the conference at 1pm Thursday for the evening networking. \n\nFast forward to 11pm, we\u2019re having a beer before heading to bed after the networking is over, and I get a call from my wife:\n\n\u201cI think my water broke.\u201d\n\n\u201cUmm.. what?!?\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re still 3 weeks early so I say no you\u2019re probably not, go back to bed. Did some quick searches and Dr Google said that because she wasn\u2019t having contractions, and she was otherwise feeling fine otherwise, it might just be pee from baby pressing on her bladder. No need to alarm. \n\n10 minutes later I get a text, \u201ccontractions started and they hurt like hell. Going to hospital now.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s home alone and has no way to get to the hospital so is thinking of calling an ambulance, so my friend says his wife will go pick her up and take her. I tell my wife what\u2019s going on and she agrees (she\u2019s almost incoherent at this point and can\u2019t talk or stand during contractions).\n\nMeanwhile, we grab our shit and hit the road. 2.5 hours, we should be able to make it in time for the birth. Labors usually take 6-12 hours. No big deal. \n\nShe gets to the hospital and they tell her that she\u2019s fully dilated and baby\u2019s already crowning. \n\nAt this point they get her straight into a room (too late for an epidural), my friends wife gets me on FaceTime, and I watch in the passenger seat of a car via FaceTime my daughter being born in record time. \n\nTotal time from water breaking to delivered child: 2.25 hours. \n\nI missed it by an hour. We get there and come cruising in and I got to meet my exhausted wife and beautiful baby daughter. \n\nSo good news, I have a beautiful, healthy baby girl, bad news is I wasn\u2019t physically there. But she can\u2019t get me in trouble because she sent me to the conference! \n\nTl;dr: wife sent me to a conference, didn\u2019t think we\u2019d have a baby that early, ended up having a baby that early and I missed it.",

        "Title": "TIFU by lying on my resume and getting caught red handed mid-interview for a job I was already vastly underqualified for",
        "Body/Content": "Obligatory did not happen today. Actually happened maybe 7 years ago but the pain is still so raw. It\u2019s like the memory is literally burned into my conscious as a reminder that no matter how bad things are, at least it\u2019s not as bad as the day I literally let down every single person I knew and respected all at once.\n\nWhen I was like 20-21, I had just graduated with a sparkling world of possibility as a sportscaster and I had somehow managed to create a position for myself with a team in a *Professional Sports Franchise (PSF)* farm system doing fluff pieces for the Jumbotron and their YouTube channel with a giant shitty camera from like 1982 and a shitty video editing software that I\u2019m sure 12 year olds now use to live stream themselves opening boxes or whatever it is they do these days.\n\nNow I am and have always been more of an analytical thinker and my interest/aim in all of this was more so related to the actual analysis and advanced statistical posturing of amateur players. Not the creative aspect of video editing and cutting footage.\n\nSo anyway, in the process of working this job where the big focus was being on camera and talking about things that were so shallow and outside of my comfort zone but also actual production work cutting and editing footage, I met the Director of Scouting of the parent *PSF* team and began talking to him in between periods when I\u2019d bring them the period summary stat packets. I was a big fan of his growing up and I definitely did not hide that well. But thankfully, he found it funny and allowed me to linger.\n\nNow I can be a pretty chatty person so of course I used every second I had with him to my advantage and would force myself into his/the other scouts conversations. Eventually, he actually welcomed my input when it became clear that I had a deep interest in statistics and at the time, the league was first moving towards accepting it more for its predictive value. \n\nSo anyway, we ended up building a good repertoire but about 2/3 of the way into the season, he was called back to the parent team to take over as interim GM. There were some big shit going down and a lot of \u201creorganization.\u201d \n\nSo I of course try to take advantage of the situation, and ask him if I can use him as a reference for some on-camera gigs I was applying for. One of these gigs was at a huge national network\u2014 small on-camera role but big on production. But it\u2019s a way in right? So I call him like he has nothing better to do as the new general fucking manager of this *PSF* team and I insist that my having this position can be good for him. It\u2019s always good to have the media on your side in a transition like this, I told him. We can help each other, I said.\n\nAnd god fucking dammit, he was too nice of a person to say no. So he said okay and he calls up the fucking COO of the entire media company and he VOUCHES for me. \n\nSo let\u2019s recap: I\u2014 a dumbass 21 year old with a big mouth and shitty video editing skills\u2014 convinced this *PSF* GM that he should call in a reference if only for the fact that I would then stop nagging him. So this man actually sticks his neck out for me and puts his name on the line while in a totally new position of power, and asks the COO of the entire national conglomerate to personally call in a favor to get me in for an interview for a position that is 90% video editing.\n\nBack then, the video editing software that most TV stations used was Avid while as students, we were trained on Final Cut Pro or whatever. Now Avid is a whole different type of situation. The computer/controls/equipment/keyboard are all completely unique. So when the job called for Avid, I thought to myself okay I can handle this. How different can video editing software be? So I add proficiency in Avid to my resume. Harmless right? \n\nSo anyway, the COO calls in the favor. I get phone calls from the News AND Sports Director personally and they are telling me how glad they are that I have this interest and can I send over a demo reel and blabla. \n\nI\u2019m on fucking cloud nine right? I never in a million years could\u2019ve imagined the stars aligning in a more perfect arrangement. ALL I had to do now is make sure that I didn\u2019t fuck up the interview.\n\nSo of course I prepared my answers, bought a new suit, worked on an elevator pitch\u2014 I mean I am literally cringing as I type this so fucking hard remembering how I walked into that news room like I already had the job. The receptionist brought me coffee and the sports director came out to walk me back to his office personally and I\u2019m smiling at everyone like I was on a fucking parade float. \n\nIn my mind, I\u2019m thinking: wow I\u2019m so proud of myself for getting myself here and networking and selling myself. I\u2019m so great. I\u2019m basically fucking invincible.\n\nSo the first part of the interview goes excellent. The sports director asks me all these questions I already knew he was going to ask. I cracked a few jokes. He laughed a little too hard. Invincible right?\n\nSo then he says: \u201cgreat, so you know you\u2019re stuff. But I just want to clarify that a lot of this role is going to be production-oriented.\u201d Because after all, this is just a producer job with a tiny on-camera perk. And I say: \u201cof course! I have experience in every major video editing software... FCP, Premiere, Avid...\u201d\n\nAnd he says: \u201cperfect. We saw that on the resume, but just wanted to clarify that you\u2019re comfortable working with Avid as a lot of young recent grads don\u2019t have a lot of exposure with that.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh yea! Of course. I have YEARS of experience,\u201d I say. \u201cI used to produce for *local tv station near school*\u201d \n\nWhich isn\u2019t ENTIRELY untrue. I did work on the avid computer like twice in the time I interned there but mostly used FCP for their digital content.\n\nBut what could it hurt? Worst case scenario, I could just go home and learn it before I start. Easy peasy.\n\nSo just as I think this lovely interview is coming to a close, he says: \u201cgreat, so the hard part\u2019s over. Now Pat (idk whatever we want to call him) here *large grisly man walks in* is going to take you to the edit bay, and you just have to cur some quick clips. Nothing fancy. We just have to go through the motions, you understand.\u201d \n\nI most certainly did not fucking understand. No one told me that they were going to be fucking fact checking me. Oh now I have to be able to actually DO the job?? This was not what I signed on for.\n\nGod fucking dammit.\n\nMy heart literally fell out my ass. And I followed this man with what I can only picture to look like a funeral procession. And you know what, it wouldn\u2019t be deceiving because I was in fact grieving. I was mourning the loss of my damn dignity.\n\nWe sit down in the edit bay. And I try to pull some quick thinking. I heard someone say he really loved superheroes so I start chatting him up about the new Marvel movies coming out and he\u2019s engaged so I\u2019m thinking if I just keep this going, he might\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014 forget why we were here. \n\nUnfortunately for me, he moved right the fuck on. He says to me: \u201cyou look a little nervous but I just want to say honestly, you\u2019ve got nothing to worry about. I\u2019m not here to like evaluate your skills. Just want to check the box so we can move forward.\u201d \n\nI say \u201cyea of course sure. Yea so you want me to like get started?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure whenever you\u2019re ready\u201d\n\n\u201cAwesome okay so... hmm... what do I want to show you first...\u201d\n\nFirst time I\u2019m looking down at the fucking Wingdings keyboard and trying to decode these damn hieroglyphics. \n\n\u201cHonestly just cut that clip in that channel and you\u2019re good.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m still looking at the keyboard desperate to avoid eye contact. \n\nHe says: \u201cor you could just trim that clip. You know whatever you want.\u201d\n\nStill no response.\n\n\u201cYou want me to open up an existing file maybe so you don\u2019t have worry about the ingestion.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m more worried about my digestion at this point. Very close to puking. In fact, considered puking to avoid this meltdown but turns out my digestive functions are about as within my control as this situation.\n\nSo he looks at me concerned because over the last maybe what like 5 minutes I have said NOTHING. For the first time since I walked into that building, I had nothing to say.\n\nSo I panic and think to myself: FUCK DO SOMETHING\n\nSo I hit a bouton that looked like a film reel and nothing happened so I hit a few more and just kept hitting buttons till something happened. And what happened was that I DELETED the file he had up for that night\u2019s broadcast. \n\nHe starts panicking and is trying not to make eye contact with me now as I\u2019m clearly fighting tears. And I just say: \u201cI don\u2019t know man. I\u2019m drawing a blank here.\u201d\n\nAnd then he starts consoling me telling me oh you know interviews are so hard and nerve wracking and stress can do that to you, you know make your mind go blank. It\u2019s really no big deal.\n\nNow remember, I said not only that I had experience but that I had YEARS of it.\n\nAnyway, I blacked out I think because I can\u2019t remember how I left that edit bay and ended up in the News Director\u2019s office\u2014 this is the woman that like runs the whole place.\n\nSo I\u2019m in there and she\u2019s saying shit like we really like you but it seems like YOU don\u2019t actually want this job. Tell me what you actually want and I\u2019m going to help you get there. I say some random shit about how this is important to me or something. I don\u2019t even remember.\n\nWhat I do remember in vivid detail are the black vinyl floor tiles leading from her office aaaaaaallll the way past the edit bays, the studio, the new room and the receptionist to the door out of the fucking building. Because I did not look up once. I said nothing to anyone and I went to my car and I cried. For an hour. \n\nBecause let\u2019s recall here that this was supposed to be it. My big break. I had worked for over a year to get this GM\u2019s buy in. Had him call in favors to the COO and that COO had to call in favors to the news director who called in a favor with the executive producer to get me this shot. All I had to do was be able to do a semi-competent job of acting like I\u2019ve been there before.\n\nI spent the next three to six months ducking all my friends, family members and professional acquaintances so I didn\u2019t have to explain how I effectively ruined my broadcasting career before it ever really started. \n\nAnd that, kids, is my cautionary tale about lying on your resume. It\u2019s just really not worth it. \n\n**TLDR: Got cocky and blatantly lied on my resume and interview, after pulling every string I didn\u2019t know I had access to, effectively blowing my one big break in the industry.**\n***********************************************\n\n\nEdit: wow, thank you so much guys for all the supportive comments, messages and awards! \n\nI really didn\u2019t anticipate you all being so kind. But no, I really was a total asshole and don\u2019t deserve your sympathy. But definitely appreciate it! Just got too big for my britches and needed that backhand to the face to really wake up and smell the manure. \n\nFor those of you asking, this wasn\u2019t the end of my career in *professional sport* but definitely a wake-up call.\n\nI sulked for a few months after and I was pretty traumatized. But after laying low for like maybe 5-6 months, I realized that maybe I was forcing it too much. I hated editing and I really was so uncomfortable on camera too, but I hid it well because I thought it would be the only way anyone would take my analysis seriously. I\u2019ve never played and I\u2019m a woman so in my mind at least, this was my one good option to be respected in the industry. But you can\u2019t fit a square peg into a circle hole (I mean I guess like depending on diameter...).\n\nAnyway, I just ended up cold-calling all the scouts and media members I had met over the course of my short-lived career. And I ended up speaking with one particular scout who I eventually became good friends with. He suggested maybe the reason it didn\u2019t work out was because I was doing it for all the wrong reasons. I agreed.\n\nSo I stayed in *professional sport* for another 3 years. And pretty successfully\u2014at least what I define as personal success! I ghostwrote a couple of reference books for a big-time broadcaster, got a couple of scouting apprenticeships and was recruited by a *PSF* ownership group for a strategy position. All things that were more in my wheelhouse. And don\u2019t ask how, but I eventually made the jump to tech and ran a startup that failed before I had a chance to run it into the ground. But then a successful one which led me to where I am now as an emerging tech architect, in the process of working on a book deal for something extremely boring to most people. Lol Definitely not creative writing. But thank you and I\u2019m glad you got a good laugh!! \n\nI think writing this post and reading your comments and messages have honestly helped me laugh at the experience more and cringe a little less. But it\u2019s all learning experiences right? Definitely never made that mistake again. Other ones for sure. But definitely not that one!\n\nI do wonder some times what my life would\u2019ve been, but honestly, I would\u2019ve been just like a repressed ball of anxiety. And I\u2019m pretty happy where I am today. I\u2019m a pretty driven person so tech gives me a lot of room for both restrained creativity and big-dreaming. So no worries everyone! I\u2019m okay! And you\u2019ll be okay too. I mean I don\u2019t know what you did, but I\u2019m pretty confident you\u2019ll be fine.",

        "Body/Content": "Why pay for a bunch of TV advertisements when you can pay a bunch of [college kids](https://xkcd.com/1019/) to make posts using specialized sockpuppet software?\n\nAn article from Deutschlandfunk describes how \"online armies take on defense work and information policy for Elon Musk\" via tech blogs and social media.\n\nIn addition, Tesla's clean-energy division Tesla Energy is alleged to have a team dedicated to searching for customer complaints on social media and asking them to delete their comments.\n\nA separate team is dedicated to managing negative social media posts aimed specifically at Elon Musk. (hello team Musk, your boss needs to go to jail!)\n\nResearchers found 186 bot accounts on Twitter that have consistently published positive sentiments about Tesla, which they say \"may have **buffered the Tesla narrative from an emergent group of critics, relieved downward pressure on the Tesla stock price and amplified pro-Tesla sentiment** from the time of the firm's IPO in June 2010 to the end of 2020.\"\n\nSocial media has a bot problem.\n\nEdit: Someone should probably throw Musk in jail for market manipulation and fraud honestly. He makes claims about vaporware every year to pump stock prices only to fail to deliver actual products. He comes up with new vaporware or kicks the deadline for products when questioned.\n\nIt's purely fraud to bump stock and should be tried as such.

        "Body/Content": "I have no background in macroeconomics. In fact, I'm in healthcare. However, this is what I've gathered in all of my 3 months of investing, learning more about econ and finance than my own field. You tell me what you think and where we stand. The title of my post... pretty much sums up my thoughts. If I made any mistakes, please let me know. After all, I'm a smooth \ud83e\udde0.\n\n# 1. S&P 500 inflation-adjusted earnings yield \ud83d\udd25\n\nYou may have seen this picture from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/niem73/sp_500_inflationadjusted_earnings_yield_falls/). It's the **S&P 500 inflation-adjusted earnings yield that's now falling below zero, setting a 40-year low**. The last times it fell below 0 were in 2008 (housing bubble), 2000 (dotcom bubble), 1987 (Black Monday), 1973 (recession). And it's going under again. Here's [another post about it, with Crescat Capital's letter.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nil0ww/sp_500_negative_yield_crescat_capital_letter_may/) Essentially, impending boom ?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jgvo3ctrpb171.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=6417c2f97f4dbbdfb4c114fff9abfa1b0fe034f8\n\n# 2. The Repo Market \ud83d\udca3\n\nIt's been all the talk lately. Lately, the Fed has been conducting reverse repo operations at higher and **higher** amounts. On May 20th, we hit the 5th highest ever with $351B and 48 participating counterparties.\n\nThen on **May 21st, reverse repos reached $369B with 52 participants!** Compare this to two weeks ago where we had less than half that amount, $155B on May 6th. Here's a chart showing reverse repos from January til today. Notice the exponential increase ? Ya, shit is fucked.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cf707nbxpb171.png?width=793&format=png&auto=webp&s=a804fd59f761970edd40cf1a76b2ca4e8fb5ac65\n\nData from: [https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/temp](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/temp)\n\nEdit: 05/25: reverse repo @ $432.96 billion.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the repo market, I recommend reading this: [The Imminent Liquidity Crisis & Reverse Repos Usage](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nhepn1/the_imminent_liquidity_crisis_reverse_repos_usage/) or watching George Gammon's YouTube video (Repo Market Rates Turn Negative).\n\nWat mean? Means there is too much cash in the system and not enough collateral (like treasury bonds). It means there's an imbalance between dollars (which are essentially IOUs) and whatever is backing the dollar's worth.\n\nWhy imbalance ?\n\n* Quantitative easing (money printer go BRRRR)\n* Rehypothecation (the same treasury bond being lent to A for 10k, who lent it to B for 10k, who lent it to C for 10k, ... but there is only 1 treasury bond and now 30k was lent.)\n* Probably more reasons\n\nSo now, nobody wants $ (except you and I) and all of these institutions want treasury bonds. And as of May 21, **treasury bonds have a negative interest rate!** Source: [https://www.dtcc.com/charts/dtcc-gcf-repo-index](https://www.dtcc.com/charts/dtcc-gcf-repo-index)\n\n[U. S. Treasury \\< 30-year maturity \\(371487AE9\\).](https://preview.redd.it/fbzehm75rb171.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=860034b8555e891462abedd4753be32043dfece4)\n\nIn other words, banks and institutions want these treasury bonds so bad, they're ready to pay (lend) what it's worth and pay some more cash to get their hands on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 3. Crypto Correction / Crash \u26a1\n\nThe crypto market dropped $1 trillion in the past 2 weeks ($700 billion last week and \\~$300 billion the week before if I got my facts right). The leading coin went from \\~$59k to \\~$30k and all other coins followed.\n\nSo there's a LOT of differing opinions on this matter, on why it happened... Elon Musk, China, etc. Let's agree that it was probably a combination of everything. It also seems that the leading coin followed a textbook Wyckoff distribution, essentially a method to fleece retail investors (yet again!).\n\n[Huge volume spike on May 19th.

Oh, right! OCC had previously issued a letter to members notifying them of temporary increase in deposits for clearing fund size totaling [$588M due at 9:00 AM on 5/19/2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nftyg4/occ_has_issued_a_statement_to_all_clearing/). So, let's all agree the crash was caused by a combination of **everything.**\n\n[Many coins were affected 6 days ago.

        "Title": "TIFU by accidentally complimenting a patients penis",
        "Body/Content": "This happened yesterday and Im still horrified and laughing about it. Im an ultrasound tech. I had a patient come in for an ultrasound because he has some swelling in one of his testicles. The normal procedure is I leave the room, he takes off his pants and underwear and lays on the exam table and covers up with a sheet. I come back in the room and place a towel over his groin while pulling down the sheet. He remains covered. I place another towel over his legs below the testicles. This keeps only the testicles exposed during the procedure. \n\n\nEverything good so far. The scan involves checking each testicle as well as the surrounding area. For the most part this is just place and, get image, repeat. As Im working, I can see he is slightly uncomfortable and keeps moving. It's not uncommon for men to get an erection. Typically I ignore it but this guy is shifting enough that Im not able to get images. I say \"Don't worry about it. It's normal but I need you to hold still.\"\n\n\nHe settles down and I continue. The towel is bulging enough that I can tell he still has the erection. I need images of the urethra so I am checking his shaft also. Yep still hard. OK so this guy is hot! I have an attractive man laying on the table with no pants and an erection covered by nothing more than a bulging towel while my hand is rubbing a wand along the length of his erection. No big deal Im a professional. I finish and start to put the machine away but between his moving and my nervousness I don't realize that the cord is under the edge of the towel. The towel starts to slide off as I pull so I reach down to stop it. Im reaching between the bed and the ultrasound machine and lose my balance. I have a hold of the towel as I start to fall and rip it off. A blob of what I hope is lube from the ultrasound catapults up and hits me in the face as Im bent over. Not thinking, I use the towel that is already in my hand to wipe myself off. As Im wiping my face on this guy's loin cloth I get a good view of him. After a moment I realize that Im just staring at his extremely large and very erect penis. He is completely exposed but afraid to cover himself because I already got onto him for moving earlier. I start to apologize. I meant to say something along the lines of \"oh my God Im so sorry\". Instead what comes out is \"wow impressive\". I mentioned Im professional right?\n\n\nI lay the towel back over him, fumble to put the machine away and tell him to get dressed and open the door when he is done. He tries to tell me it's no big deal when he was leaving but I was so embarrassed that I couldn't even make eye contact.\n\n\nEdit: I'm not sure why this became so popular. There is a lot of mix between 'you made his day' and 'you should be fired'. I admit it was a mistake and I didn't intend to say something. I hope I didn't make him uncomfortable with my comment. I reported it to my supervisor though and was (am) willing to accept the consequences. I admit it was a mistake on my part. Yes I'm female. No I wasn't trying to brag that women get away with abuse. Yes I'm human and make mistakes. Yes I apologized to the man several times for both my comment and for my clumsiness. He wasn't upset when he left the office but if he files a complaint then I will understand and I will live with it. No I did not ask him out. No I will not call him from his file. I have to get ready for work now. I will either reply to more comments or delete this post entirely later. I wasn't trying to create unwanted attention for this man or make light of the situation. I was still horrified by it when I posted so thank you to those that supported me because you helped me relax over the situation but I don't consider that permission to do it again. Thank you strangers for the gold/silver/platinum.\n\n\nEdit2: Quick update over lunch break because this has taken off so much. I expected 20 people to read it and along. My supervisor pulled me off one of my appointments earlier and called me into his office where other hospital personnel were waiting. I knew what was coming next. After I reported the incident my supervisor filed a report. This kicked off a whole process which included someone reaching out to the patient proactively for damage control. The good news is that the guy isn't upset. He had no clue why they were calling him and they said he started laughing when they explained. He was apparently apologizing to them and thought it was a waste of their time. He said and this is the best part that if he has to come back he hopes I'll be there. :) The bad part is I had to sign some forms for the hospital and was reminded that I need to be more careful. I feel I got lucky because this could have been much worse. \n\n\nTL;DR I saw a patients penis and rather than apologize I told him it was impressive.",

        "Body/Content": "**I am not OP.**\n\nPosted by u/SuddenSurrender on r/legaladvice. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n[**Original**](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9rfvil/ohiomy_husband_was_killed_in_a_car_accident) _- October 26, 2018_\n\nForgive me if this is a little disjointed, I am still reeling from trying to wrap my head around my current situation. My husband passed away very suddenly recently and in the weeks since his passing I have discovered that he was keeping huge secrets from me.\n\nIn going through our financial information, I have discovered multiple credit cards in his, mine and the kids names that are at maximum balance, 2 sets of loan papers from different banks for over $20,000, paperwork that says our mortgage is 4 months behind and a ton of other things that I can barely make sense of. From what I can tell, his business hasn't been making any actual money in over a year and our savings accounts are drained. There is evidence that he has been using some gambling website and has lost thousands and thousands of dollars. I've been a stay at home mom for our entire marriage and he owned his own business so he handled everything with the money.\n\nI have no idea how to deal with any of this or what to do. I know I need a lawyer but our accounts are pretty much empty and I am at a total loss over what to do. Are there any free legal options I can look into? I have tried to call a bunch of lawyers and all of them have said they won't give out any advice or counsel over the phone. Am I liable for all this debt even though I didn't consent to my name and certainly not my kids' names being used to open credit cards? I feel like an idiot for being this uninformed but I am completely unprepared to deal with this and I am terrified we are going to lose our house and worse. I never in a million years dreamed he would do this to us. Can anyone point me in the right direction please?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[**Update 1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9vvejz/update_post_husband_killed_in_a_car_crash_left_us/) _- November 11, 2018_\n\n\nI wanted to give you an update since so many people gave advice and said such kind things.\n\nFirst of all, thank you to everyone who commented and gave me advice. I'm sorry I didn't respond on the other post, I was just so completely overwhelmed, I still am really, but I did read every comment and message and I appreciate everyone that took the time to comment.\n\nI was able to find some legal help and we are working on sorting out the mess my family is in. Things were far worse than I even knew when I made my first post. All together, the debt that was accumulated is close to half a million dollars. At this point I have no idea how much I am going to end up responsible for. The lawyer has said it could take years to sort everything out.\n\nNo matter what happens, we are going to be losing the house. I am working on finding us somewhere to stay before they actually foreclose so we don't get evicted and have that on my record too.\n\nI want to try to answer some of the questions and advice people mentioned in the other post.\n\nI have 3 kids, so that is the we that I keep saying. The older two are from a previous relationship but I have contacted social security to get benefits started for my youngest. Thank you to the user who mentioned that.\n\nMy husband's business was a computer/tech repair company he ran by himself. He had a few people he would call in to help with larger jobs but 95% of everything was him alone. The last year or so it appears he wasn't doing any actual work and there was no money coming in. He took money from the business to cover what he took from our personal accounts and then took out loans to cover the business and pissed it all away on gambling and other illegal activities that have come to light over the past few weeks. Sorry to be vague, it's just embarrassing and hard to talk about.\n\nTo the people who said that maybe the crash was intentional, it is looking increasingly likely that it was. Nobody else was involved, his car went off the road and hit a tree. He had life insurance before, but he stopped paying the policy months ago.\n\nI am in contact with the police about the credit cards in our names and the other things that were discovered.\n\nAll in all, things are looking really bleak at the moment but I have faith that eventually it will work out. I have a few leads on jobs and have picked up a little temp work here and there the last few weeks so that we have something coming in. I have signed up for food stamps and Medicaid so once that goes through it will be a bit of help. I applied for AMHA as well but they said the waitlist can be a few years wait so that is a kind of longshot. Someone has suggested asking family/friends for help or loans and they absolutely would help me if they could but none of them are in a financial position to be able to help. My sister will hopefully be able to let us stay with her temporarily until I can sort things out and get us back together. She is my only living family and has been my rock through all this.\n\nSo yeah, I guess that's it. Thank you all again for listening and helping. If anyone else has any more suggestions on trying to pick up the pieces that I haven't thought of, I would appreciate any advice\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[**Update 2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9zulbq/update_final_update_to_my_husband_commiting/) _- November 24, 2018_\n\n\nThis will probably be my last update, I hope at least.\n\nFirst of all, sorting things out didn't take nearly as long as we thought it would. Things ended up being a lot more straightforward than they first appeared. I will be filing for bankruptcy, probably early next year. I've talked extensively with the lawyer and weighed my options and that seems like the best way to move forward at this point. 90%-95% of the debt should be discharged with bankruptcy. So that is a good thing although it's bittersweet.\n\nWe are losing the house. We will be moving out by November 30th. I am worried about the bankruptcy/credit issues with trying to rent an apartment, however I am now on the list for pmha housing and from what I've heard the wait isn't long at all. We ended up not being able to count on staying with my sister for longer than about a week thanks to her jerky landlord, so I am trying to find something else in the meantime. I have a few options to look into. Honestly I'm not that sad about the fact that we have to move out of the house. The old place is filled with tainted memories now and I think it will be good to get a fresh start.\n\nI've been assured by the police and my lawyer that because of the criminal nature of opening the accounts in the kids' names we should be able to get their credit cleared. That one might be a long road but we'll get through that too.\nMy applications for Medicaid and food stamps came through so that is some definite stress off my shoulders. I made the girls and myself an appointment at a family counselor which we will be going to next week. The lady at pmha housing was very reassuring and very sweet about my situation and she made it sound like I was pretty much a shoo-in as soon as a place opened up.\nLast but not least I listened to the many redditors that told me to make a post over in r/santaslittlehelpers to inquire about help with Christmas for the girls. So hopefully we will be able to find some holiday help and that will be another huge load of stress lifted off my shoulders.\n\nI want to thank everyone who messaged me and offered words of encouragement and support. I can't even begin to tell you how much it means to me to know that I'm not alone. I never imagined Reddit to be an empathetic and caring source of comfort but it turns out that is exactly what it is. Thanks again everyone.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[**Final Update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a3s7ja/updateone_last_update_to_my_husband_committing/) _- December 7, 2018_\n\nHello everyone. I wanted to give one last update to my situation since so many of you reached out to me.\n\nThis has been a whirlwind few weeks. A lot of change, a lot of stress and a lot of hard work. As difficult as all this has been and will still be to go through, I am feeling more positive than I have in months. The legal issues are being dealt with as best they can for the moment and we are looking at filing bankruptcy early next year. It is scary to think about, but I do know it is our best option and things will work out in the end. We moved out of our house almost a week ago. It feels very bittersweet and the girls are having a difficult time but I know they will adjust and I really do think a fresh start will be the best thing for us. The girls are in individual grief counseling and we began family therapy. I will be making an appointment for myself as well, something so many of you encouraged me to do.\n\nSome of my good news now. We were able to find a permanent place to live, with a very sweet landlord who is sympathetic to my situation and has previous experience with the welfare system AND has bent over backwards to help me through all of the red tape. We will be moving, (again!), into the new place at the end of this month. Hopefully that will be the last time we have to move for a very long time!\n\nMy second huge piece of good news to update with is that I got a job! I am now working full time in an office of a company that is owned by someone I met through my posts here. She contacted me after my last update and offered me a trial run with her company. I started this past Monday and so far, so good! I am incredibly humbled and grateful to her for giving me a chance. That brings me to my third point and really the reason I am making this update.\nI wasn't sure what to expect when I first reached out for advice here. I just felt so overwhelmed with the situation and I think I was just mostly wanting to not feel alone and to connect with and talk to people who had some understanding of what I was dealing with. The response I got from all of you has been astonishing. The advice, the stories of dealing with similar circumstances, the encouraging messages, the fact that you all literally [saved Christmas for me and my kids](https://imgur.com/uwSkbin), A NEW FREAKING JOB, and just the empathy and kindness you all have shown to me and my family is so far beyond anything I expected that I don't even know the words to express how grateful and humbled and loved it has made me feel. It is going to be a long, tough road, but I have total faith that things will be okay and that is in large part due to the r/legaladvice community.\n\nSo in closing, I want to say THANK YOU to every single person who reached out to me in any way, shape or form. Thank you for lifting us up and helping us through this. You guys have saved me in a million different ways and I will always be grateful. I hope you all have the Merriest Christmas ever!",

        "Body/Content": "The edit you\u2019ve all been waiting for at the bottom. \n\nI\u2019ve been working as a technician in medical insurance for the last two years. In that amount of time I\u2019ve out performed nearly everyone else. I finished my degree in Communication. I\u2019ve won a handful of low level quality and candor awards. \n\nMy annual review will be completed within the next six hours. Then I will know if I get a raise, a bonus, and other privileges. 60% of technicians fall into the 3/5 point range which is considered where most techs are supposed to be. I told my manager last year I wanted to get a 5 and he told me how hard it was. \n\n4/5 points: 30% of technicians obtain. \n5/5 points: 2% of technicians obtain. \n\nTwo weeks ago he said he is going to fight to get me a 5/5 rating. \n\nIf I get this my bonus will be larger than the amount of credit card debt I\u2019m in. My raise will be enough for me to afford a car finally. \n\nI would like some good vibes. I\u2019m jumping out of my skin. I don\u2019t want to depend on this money but I really am. This year has financially killed me I\u2019m clawing my way back up but just can\u2019t afford to pay everything off as fast as I need to.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m overwhelmed with support I\u2019m so grateful for all of you! I\u2019m still waiting but bet that I\u2019ll post an update once I know!\n\nEdit 2: meeting got pushed back to 4 CST. If you think you\u2019re bristling with anticipation imagine how I feel!!!\n\nEdit 3: guys it\u2019s only 3:15 CST I don\u2019t know yet and I\u2019m even more anxious! Thank you for all the good you\u2019ve sent my way I\u2019ve still got a bit to go but I will know in about 45 minutes to an hour!\n\nEdit 4: \nGuys I\u2019m crying as I write this. The fact that thousands of people from all over the world took time in their day to give me words of encouragement and support is so amazing. Thank you all. \n\nSo the reason my supervisor pushed my meeting back so far in the day is because his manager tabled the conversation on me. \n\nMy supervisor compiled every kudos, compliment, certificate, award, training document, and project I have worked on this year. His manager wanted to take the time to look through all of what he had so she paused on me and they addressed my other team members first. \n\nHe fought for 45 minutes giving every reason he possibly could to give me all 5 points. His manager was hesitant. They\u2019d only awarded 3 other techs this year so far because of the strict criteria and her guidelines for how to award points. \n\nHe pressed her, pleaded my case, and showed all of the documentation he possibly could to prove I deserved to the rating. And I am so thankful for all that he did. \n\nBut despite all of the efforts he made I still got the news that nearly killed me. \n\nNow that I\u2019ve given you all the same heart attack that he gave me I GOT THE RATING. \n\nI AM ONE OF FOUR TECHNICIANS. \n\nLess than 1% of technicians were awarded all 5 points and I\u2019m one of them! New car and no debt coming this January.\n\nEdit 5: you all are amazing. To answer some FAQ: \n\n1. I plan on buying a used car, I have owned 2 cars in the past and they were both 5 years or older and used. \n\n2. A medical insurance technician processes insurance claims made by patients (I have no control whether the company covers things or not so please don\u2019t blame the tiny screw in the giant cog of fucked up healthcare) \n\n3. I am going to pay off all of my credit card debt first. If the remainder of my bonus is enough for a down payment then yes I\u2019m getting a car I need/want ASAP but if not then I\u2019ll be saving the remainder. \n\n4. I do have a 401k and a retirement plan with Edward Jones.",

        "Body/Content": "/edit: Hi /r/all. While I have your attention, I want to take 5 seconds of your time and bring some exposure to something that is threatening our existence as the human race. If you aren't interested, please skip down to the main article. I'm talking about finding a way to live sustainably on this planet, regenerative agriculture, where we get our food from, and how we can make sure that our kids and grandkids have something left once we leave. \n\nPlease consider reading up on Permaculture, sustainable living, Forest gardening, Backyard Chickens, etc. Consider following what I did and do it for yourself. [This all used to be a useless lawn.](https://youtu.be/U79bql-JSqI)\n\n[Bored for a night? Go watch \"Sustainable\" on Netflix.](https://sustainablefoodfilm.com/) \n\nLook into people like [Geoff Lawton](http://www.geofflawtononline.com/), Mark Shepard, Sepp Holzer, these people are going to save us. \n\nWant to make a small change yourself? Grow a tomato plant on your balcony in a pot. Reduce transport of the tomatoes you eat, and make ~$50 per plant in saved money. Want to do something bigger? Plant a fruit tree in your backyard. Maybe two. Maybe a raspberry bush. You are now part of saving the human race.\n\nIf everyone reading this planted a fruit tree, or even some wild flowers, we could save the bees.\n\nWhile you are at it, planting a fruit tree has been shown to be one of the best investments on the planet. There's pretty much no investment on the planet that is more financially lucrative (while still being nearly bullet-proof safe) than planting a fruit tree.\n\nYou can get a tree at an end of sale auction for literally 5-10 bucks, and that tree will produce THOUSANDS of dollars of fruit for you in it's lifetime. Go spend $200 bucks at an end of season sale, plant 10-20 trees (if you have room), and that $200 will be worth tens of thousands of dollars of saved money.\n\nDo it right, [set it up right and it's almost no work](https://youtu.be/bjBLVSo0zeY) because you offload the work to nature - as it has done for the last few billion years. Go learn how, let me show you how. If you do it right, it's zero work after you have planted and wood-chipped, and all you do is pull dollars off a tree.\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nOriginal post starts below. I apologize for the shilling of Permaculture, but I think loss of topsoil will impact us all if we don't reverse it soon. We need soil, we need bees, we need food. We need to stop buying December Bananas in Canada. We need to start supporting local permaculture sustainable farms. We need to do this or we may not make it, and our grandkids stand no chance.\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n**I also expended the \"now what happens\" section, to explain how these pullbacks are a good thing, make crypto more stable, and why we keep seeing larger ceilings after every pullback... this stuff is really important for you to make money on this thing, if that's your goal....**\n\nI've made a similar post in a few spots, and this is something that is absolutely critical for people to understand... what impacts price, and what is going on lately. Price has only a very minor correlation with money invested, and a major correlation with opinion. \n\n... and Humans are an emotional bunch.\n\nSo what drives price of any commodity, crypto, gold, pizzas, whatever? The money invested in it, right? Kind of, but not really. What if I told you that you could theoretically raise bitcoin from $15k to $20k by spending $1, and lower it from $25k to $1k by spending the same $1? Crazy right?\n\n**AN EXAMPLE**\n\nThis is going to start out slow, I want to make sure I get everyone on the same page before I pick things up and lift the curtain. Stick with me here....\n\nThis is an example to help illustrate why prices aren't driven by money invested, but rather consensus and opinion. Lets imagine the following exists (we will use bitcoin as an example, but this is how everything on the planet works)\n\nLets say Bitcoin is currently priced at $10k (the last sale). From $11k to $99k, every $1k there is someone with a sell order of 1 full bitcoin. From $9k to $1 dollar, every $1k on the way down there is someone with a buy order of 1 full bitcoin.\n\nSo, right now if you wanted to buy bitcoin you have several options... meet the lowest seller's price of $11k, or, put your own buy order up, above the highest buyer's bid order (overcut them). If you decide to just place an order, the price doesn't change. If you decide the buy the $11k bitcoin, now bitcoins value is $11k, with a new lowest sell offer of $12k, and a highest buy bid of $10k. Someone else comes in an overcuts the buy bid and puts 1 BTC for sale for $11k. No trades are made until someone matches a buy/sell.\n\nOkay, that's kindergarten stuff, most people here understand that. So how much money drove the price up in this situation? $11k, and BTC price raised 11/10, 1.10, or 10% from the last sale. Now the entire marketcap of BTC raised 10% (last sale multiplied by circulating supply). So it takes $11k to drive a 10% increase, right? Not at all. Lets look at what happens when news is released.\n\nNews comes out that Warren Buffet thinks bitcoin is a scam, a bubble, and he wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole because he only invests in things he understands and he doesn't understand crypto. People panic everywhere, and believe \"this guy is smart, I'm overvaluing this thing\".\n\nSuddenly people don't want to buy this scam anymore, and the buy orders for $11k, $10, and $9k are taken down. \n\nAt the same time, the people wanting to sell start to panic and just want out. The guy at $32k (who just had that offer up \"just incase it moons\") drops down to $11k sell order. The guy at $12k, who was the lowest, now undercuts him to $10k. \n\nThe other buyers see the sellers undercutting and think that if these people want out, why am I buying in. The $8k guy pulls his offer, and so do the $7k, $6k and $5k guys. The highest offer is now $4k. \n\nThe sellers panic further and the $14k guy undercuts the $10k guy and puts up a $9k sell. The $15k, 17k and 11k guys all see this flurry of panic and now a storm undercutting is triggered, to $8k, $7k, and $6k. The $8k order pulls his again and goes down to $5k. \n\nThe price on the buy and sell orders has moved around a ton, but no sales have actually happened yet. Technically, BTC is still \"worth\" $11k, and the market cap reflects that. All this horseshit has happened, and it only happened in 10 seconds, but the price hasn't moved yet. \n\nThe $27k guy wakes up and checks his phone. He had a $27k offer just incase the price moved also, and he also only has a tiny infinitesimal fraction of a BTC. Well, he decides \"he's out\" and fills $1 worth of the part of the $4k guys buy offer.\n\nThe latest price information is now updated, and BTC fell from $11k to $4k price per BTC with the movement of a single dollar.\n\nThis is exaggerated example, but this is what moves price. Not money in vs money out. The ONLY THING that moves price is perception.\n\n**OPINION FLOW AND NOT MONEY FLOW**\n\nNow the above example only happens if everyone simultaneously believe the same thing... this the asset they are holding is a steaming turd. What happens in reality is there's no black and white, it's shades of gray. It's flow in vs flow out. But again, not flow MONEY, but rather OPINIONS.\n\nIf 66% of the holders of something all of a sudden unanimously decide that their asset is overvalued, then they panic sell. Even if 33% of the people decide they are going to buy up as much as these panic sellers sell, if the panic is strong enough, and they are slitting eachother's throat to sell, then the buyers just happily sit and let them do that, and time their buys in. Very little money has to actually change hands in order for this price to crash, all that matters is the FLOW OF OPINION has to be swift and violent, and in majority. The sellers will leapfrog eachother on the way down, faster than the buyers scoop up their sales, and the net result is a crashed price.\n\nNote, this happens both ways... fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) as well as overhyped FOMO (Fear of missing out). \n\n**So now what happens?**\n\nTime goes by and all holders opinions of their asset hasn't changed. They still think it's worth $11k and they got great deals scooping up what these sellers were selling. The weak hands have left the market and have been replaced with holders. Overall, now a higher percentage of holders believe in the product they are holding and are unwilling to sell for the panic prices of the last week. Panic sellers were also replaced by new money, people who have wanted in for a while and are now in on their perceived ground floor.\n\nAlso, people who bought BTC at $1 ten years ago and have been looking for an exit to cash profits have now been replaced by either long term holders, or by these new people who are thrilled to have finally entered, and they are looking to hold long. \n\nSo what happens on pullbacks? The number of people waiting to jump off the ship has decreased. The new ground floor is established. Are we done? Who knows, this could go on for another year, but what matters is that people who want off are getting off and people that want on are getting on. \n\nPeople who have panic sold and never believed in this in the firstplace... people who have wanted out for 10 years... they have been replaced by people who are now getting in on THEIR GROUND FLOOR, and are going to be holding long. The market is suddenly increasingly more stable today than it was yesterday, even though prices are down. \n\n**This is a good thing.** This is why crypto keeps bouncing back from pullbacks and reaches new higher ceilings and floors each time. Old money who wanted out, and new panic holders, they are gone. They are replaced with adopters, holders, believers in this technology. These people aren't selling anytime soon, because they believe that this thing is going to revolutionize the world. Every crash brings more of these people in, and removes more panic sellers out. \n\n**Moving forward**\n\nNow news releases start coming out about how stock ETFs are being created, NASDAQ index funds, bank support, government support. Companies are using this tech, and companies who use blockchain for transportation are putting non-blockchain companies out of business. \n\nThe people on the outside looking-in feel they are missing out. They now start coming in and buying. They start overpricing eachother on their buy orders, and eventually it gets close enough to a sell order that someone decides they are just going to meet the sell price. The sale goes through.\n\nSellers (HODLERs) see this action, and they start pulling sell orders off the table almost as fast as they fill. Sure some trades go through, and incoming money is driving the price up as market orders are filled. But what's also happening is people are seeing this flurry of volume, and sellers are pulling sell orders and placing them higher. \n\nJunk coins and pump and dump scam coins are dying by the millions. In their ashes, good solid technology projects whose coins have fundamental economic reasons for growth, these are rising. Corporate partnerships continue forming. The real world continues to create actual use cases. Companies start storing more and more corporate information on blockchain. Public companies use blockchain to store scientific research (See Canadian Research Council announcements), and blockchain acts as a Library of Alexandria. People can travel out of country without any monetary exchange, using their chosen cryptocurrency to buy the things they need abroad. The world is slowly actually USING this technology. \n\nMoney is coming in, but more importantly, OPINION IS CHANGING. Literally nothing could have happened in terms of fundamentals, partnerships, etc... this can all be driven entirely emotional, so long as it's wide-spread and strong. Infact, the market could THEORETICALLY rebound in this way from $4000/BTC to $1 MILLION PER BITCOIN by the sale of ONE PENNY. $4000 sound low? Does that number make you uncomfortable? We may go that low. We may not. If we do, I'm not panicking and selling, I'm buying more.\n\n\n**SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS? and where are we going?**\n\nA lot of new money has come in from Nov-Jan, and they don't really know what they are investing in. Sure some of them have done great research and are smart investors but most people aren't and isntead they are buying Symbols and Names and trading on speculation. They are treating their favorite coins like a sports team, and will follow them irrationally off a cliff.\n\nThese new people came in and invested in cryptocurrency because their OPINION was heavily influenced in Nov, Dec, Jan, from media. They saw this money making machine called crypto. They were willing to pay huge, ride the wave up, keep buying, etc. They were \"ground floor adopters\" and were going to get rich.\n\nThey outnumber the old money by A LOT. Their OPINION MATTERS. It matters the most.\n\nTo keep this in perspective, they are also a VAST MINORITY of \"new money\" that will enter the game in the next decade. This cycle will continue over and over and over. \n\nTheir opinion rose nearly unbounded and price rose accordingly. Market cap rose from 10B to 750B, and it could have been VERY LITTLE actual money that did this. How much did it need to be though? Literally ONE PENNY, theoretically. All that matters in moving price is MOMENTUM OF OPINION. I believe it has been estimated that as low as 6B USD was responsible for the bull rush.\n\nThese people then started hearing \"Bubble\", \"Scam\", Fake news about governments banning. They don't understand how technology wins, always. Crypto is beyond government control. If they could have stopped Bitcoin they would have done it already. \n\n**WHO IS DRIVING ALL THIS?**\n\nMost investment opportunities go first to \"accredited investors\". You need to have multimillions in order to get in on the ground floor for most stock IPOs, and we're seeing that start to happen with coin ICOs. Bitcoin was a joke for the first few years, while lunatics picked it up. At this point, it was really too late to get in \"early\", and who would have wanted to anyways, it was all still a joke. So Wallstreet, banks, governments have generally watched on the sidelines as average Joes who were crazy enough to be early adopters and toss $100 on fake internet money slowly became millionaires. \n\nNot only that, but the idea of blockchain started to become understood. The power and value in it became understood. Not only as a way to track \"monetary value\" but for many other applications as well. Platforms were created, business uses brainstormed, products started being made. This thing started taking off, and wasn't a joke anymore. But regardless, big money wasn't in on the ground floor. They have stakeholders opinions to think of, and what do they say to investors when they lose all their money on magic internet points?\n\nBut they have woken up now. This thing has \"popped\" many times now and keeps recovering. This thing won't die. could they have been wrong all along? If they want in, how do they get in? They are no dummies, they have been controlling the world their whole lives? Look at the media experiment that Trump is doing? He is testing just how we work... you can do literally anything and we remember it for like 30 seconds, until the next news story comes out. We change opinions very easily. We are swayed very easily. We are their puppets. Media controls the world. They know their way in.\n\nThey have ONE WEAPON against cryptocurrency.\n\nYOUR OPINION OF IT.\n\nAnd they know it.\n\n**Media.**\n\nThat's why FUD is so powerful and needs to be respected. It's why we need to read more than titles on news articles. We need to question what we read, **whether it's good news or bad news**. We need to think about \"what are the motives of the person saying this to me\". Does the government have a conflict of interest when they state that crypto is gambling? Do they have skin in the game? \n\nWhat about wall street? Does WEISS ratings possibly have incentive to come out with poor ratings? Do banks have incentive to lock accounts in order to \"protect\" customers from \"unsafe investments\" when their entire business model revolves around holding as much of your money as possible and making money off it? Do you think banks have any super secret hidden interest in preventing you from storing your money elsewhere? I'm not sure, maybe you can critically think about that.\n\nJust understand that this goes both ways. When crypto is booming and Fox news is showing people how to buy $4 ripple on prime time, you may want to start putting in some stop loss orders. When the suicide hotline is stickied at the top of /r/cryptocurrency and everyone is panic selling, you may want to start picking up some firesale deals. \n\nSo, the question is this... Is crypto undervalued or overvalued at it's price today? Where is the price going long term? **I'm not talking about it's use case**, I'm talking about in the **court of public opinion**, where is THAT going? Because THAT is what is going to drive price in the future.\n\nWithout a crystal ball, this is of course impossible to know. Do your own research and form your own opinion. It could very well be that the technology having a use-case will in and of itself drive opinion, and thus price. But make sure you understand that it's not the technology itself, it's not the value of the business itself, it's not the use case itself that will drive price, it is the publics OPINION of that thing which drives price. They are intertwined, but they are NOT the same thing.\n\nTLDR: VERY VERY little money has to move around in order to swing prices drastically, up or down. Money in and out doesn't drive price, OPINION does. How do you let the news you read impact your opinion?How are you being played (on both sides, shilling and FUD).\n\nSomething is only worth what people think it's worth. Often that's based on reality, value, business, money, but often it's entirely emotional.\n\n[Structure your portfolio in a balance, intelligent way, using risk methodology.](https://www.investinblockchain.com/cryptocurrency-investment-risk-management/).

Stop trying to make money overnight in pump and dump scams, or pyramid schemes. \n\nEvery day, take one coin, do a deep dive on it, learn it inside and out. Look into their team and their past. Do that every day for a year, and you just learned 365 coins inside and out. Ask yourself the following key questions:\n\nHave those members consistently jumped ship on previous projects? Is that where you want to invest in? Is their team capable of executing on their vision? Are they trying to solve world hunger, and their team is a few 16 year olds in a garage? How active is their github? Are they adding chunks of code regularly, or is a ghost town? Are they marketing their product at all? Or is marketing the only thing they are doing? \n\nWhat are the economics of their coin itself? Is it required to be used to gain access to their technology? Are there burns? How premined is it, and what portion do the founders hold? \n\nWhat about their vision? Are they trying to solve a problem that needs to be solved? What are the economics of that problem and how much money does the solution potentially save clients?\n\nThese are all questions you should be asking when you give your money to someone else. We're a lot more stable than we were - a correction was bound to happen. Too much early money wanted to cash in profits. These people have been replaced by new money who is holding on their own ground floor. The whole industry in general is still in very early stages. Rest assured that anyone reading this is still very much an early adopter. Just make sure you are investing in actual technology, and supporting capable teams, and not buying air. Buy the Googles and Amazons of Crypto, not the pets.com or flooz.com of cryptos.\n\nHappy investing everyone.\n\n/EDIT: some have asked to donate some crypto.

She posted in r/TrueOffMyChest and her own page.\n\n**THE NEWEST UPDATE IS FROM 7 DAYS AGO**. (This is based on the rules of this sub.) If you have already read that, then there is nothing new in this post.\n\nYou can read my previous BORU post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/16ta63o/two_tampons_may_mean_my_marriage_is_over/). New update marked with \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Trigger Warnings:** >!gaslighting; mentioned sex offenses against children;!<\n\n**Mood Spoiler:** >!somehow worse than expected!<\n\n**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/168kiyg/two_tampons_may_mean_my_marriage_is_over/)**: September 2, 2023**\n\nI (29F) have been with my husband (30M) for seven years, married for four. I\u2019ve never had reason to suspect he was unfaithful to me or even remotely dissatisfied with our marriage\u2014he likes to joke that we\u2019re still living the \u201choneymoon phase\u201d nearly five years and two kids in. I wouldn\u2018t have questioned that, or him, were it not for a surprise I found in his car last month.\n\nWhen buckling our daughter into her carseat, I noticed something slotted between the cushions. I pulled it out and saw that it was a tampon. This wouldn\u2019t have been so unusual had I not had an IUD that has stopped my period for the past year, and I didn\u2019t even recognize the wrapper style. I brought it to my husband\u2019s attention, and he didn\u2019t seem to understand what it was, let alone why I was holding it, until I told him where I\u2019d found it and why I was almost certain it wasn\u2019t mine. He shrugged and said it probably belonged to his coworker, Fiona. It\u2019s not uncommon for my husband to carpool to lunch with his coworkers, and we\u2019re both fairly close to Fiona and her husband, so I figured it was entirely possible the tampon had slipped out of her purse whenever he had driven with them or offered her a ride. No big deal.\n\nI put it out of my mind until we had dinner with Fiona and her husband a couple weeks later. I had sincerely wanted to believe my husband. I just couldn\u2019t get over the way it had been tucked in the seat and how my husband had seemed not to have any regard for it whatsoever. Maybe playing dumb. I don\u2019t know. I did something that I now feel kind of crazy for doing: I faked an \u201cemergency\u201d and asked Fiona if she had any tampons while we were out together.\n\nShe handed me one almost identical to the tampon I\u2019d found in our backseat, and I breathed a sigh of relief. So the tampon there was probably the same tampon here, and in all likelihood, there was an innocent explanation as to why it had been left in the backseat in the first place.\n\nI thought I\u2019d seen the last of the out-of-place feminine hygiene products until I found another tampon this morning. This time in my sock drawer. I feel physically ill at the thought of my husband having an affair and even more nauseated at the thought that the woman might have left these tampons out for me to find. If it was my husband\u2019s coworker, why would she give herself away by offering me one the other night? In any other situation I would want to talk to my husband about this, but I feel too sick, and embarrassed, to approach him with what I\u2019ve found. What should I do?\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\n*I've had a period 30 years and never put a tampon in a sock drawer. Trust your gut & get cameras:*\n\n\"Neither have I. I\u2019ve considered so many explanations for the tampons that wouldn\u2019t implicate my husband, but none of them make sense, really.\n\nI\u2019m terrified to set up a camera if it means confirming what I suspect right now.\"\n\n*Has Fiona been over to your house and had time to plant the tampon?*\n\n\"She\u2019s been to our house many times and vice versa. To my knowledge, she wasn\u2019t over any time in the past week, so if she planted that second tampon, she had to have found a window of time when I wasn\u2019t home. Any time she and her husband visit, we all stay downstairs, and you\u2019d have to go *really* out of your way to make it to our bedroom (i.e., around our dogs, over the safety gate, past the other bedrooms). Not saying it\u2019s impossible, but definitely tricky to do on a quick bathroom break, I would guess.\"\n\n*How old are your kids? Could they have found a tampon and put it in a random place?*\n\n\"2 and almost 4. Both have a mischievous streak, so I didn\u2019t want to rule out the possibility of one of them moving stuff around, but I can\u2019t imagine how they\u2019d get their hands on one, possibly two random tampons that I never bought.\"\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/16nu84v/two_tampons_may_mean_my_marriage_is_over_update/)**: September 20, 2023 (18 days later)**\n\nContemplating every possible source of two tampons has been my personal hell for the past few weeks, but I wanted to share an update.\n\nShortly after posting on here, I told my sister what happened. The tampon in the backseat and the sock drawer, my husband\u2019s cluelessness, the tampon from Fiona, and all the things I suspected but didn't want to believe. We compared tampons (save for the backseat one I had already discarded), and they were a match, just in different absorbencies. I hadn't left either in a place where my husband or daughters would have found them and moved them around. My daughters didn't know what they were or where they had come from. My sister was convinced it was Fiona\u2014either fucking my husband, fucking with me, or both. Direct confrontation of either party still seemed like a bad idea, so she suggested inviting Fiona and her husband over for our Labor Day barbecue. Unfortunately, they already had plans.\n\nMy sister and I agreed that it was too soon for cameras without any other evidence, so it was just a waiting game from there. Watching my husband for any changed behavior (there was none), our house for any misplaced/foreign items (there were none), and even the girls for any new \"friends\" they might have met. My sister's husband was adamant on this last point, and partly why he was inclined to believe that the tampons were harmless. If anything had been happening in or around our home, he said, it would be nearly impossible to keep it from me *and* the girls, since my husband was the one taking them to and from daycare and most other activities during the week. I felt a good bit of consolation in that.\n\nIt wasn't until my younger daughter (2 y/o) came down with something last week that I felt any differently. I wanted to be the one home taking care of her, but my husband insisted that I stay at work while he stayed home with her. I was OK with that, my sister and her husband figured it was a good sign that he would take the time off at a moment's notice, and at that point, we were all already beginning to put the tampon fiasco behind us. By the third or fourth day, I was just happy to see a near-healthy child and a husband who was helping see her through it. Toward the end of that week, though, I came home to something strange.\n\nThe toddler that I'd left that morning in an old PJ set was now dressed in a onesie I'd never seen before, with a tiny clip in her hair. I can't say I have the sharpest memory, but I have a pretty good sense of what my kids wear on a day-to-day basis, and particularly what kinds of clothes they wear. I'd sworn off the full-length sleep suits with snaps across the front long before we'd ever had our second (the long snaps are just a pain in the ass and a no-go for efficient diaper changes, IMO). It's just not something I would dress her in, and my husband knows as much. He doesn't plan for, or buy, the girls' clothes, and he certainly doesn't accessorize them, so I was bewildered. And kind of floored at the thought of someone around our sick child without my knowledge.\n\nI didn't think twice, and I went straight to my husband to ask if anyone had been over to see him or the girls. He seemed confused, like before, and asked me why I would think that\u2014it had just been him and the kids all day. I asked him again, if someone had so much as stopped by to say hello, and he denied it. He told me to calm down. I might've lashed out and come forward with the accusations right then and there, but our older daughter was in the room, and she sensed something was up. In a calmer voice, I asked him a third time if anyone had been around our children, and my husband swore that the girls hadn't been around anyone but him. He also denied buying new clothes or doing anyone's hair. With our daughter in the room and my emotions all over the place, I decided to leave it. I couldn't make sense of it then, and it hardly seems clearer now, after I've driven myself half-crazy with explanations that aren't adding up.\n\n***Relevant Comments:***\n\n\"To answer a couple questions:\n\n* My 2 y/o can only string together a couple words at a time, and when I ask her about her time with Daddy or her clothes/bow, she answers based on the cues I give her (e.g., \u201cWho gave you that pretty bow?\u201d and she repeats \u201cpretty bow\u201d back to me, or \u201cMama/Daddy\u201d over and over). My older daughter (almost 4) was at daycare that morning, and she can\u2019t recall anything different from that day. Doesn\u2019t remember the PJ change or the hair clip, so my guess is she was changed sometime that morning, but I\u2019m not totally sure.\n* I have a 45 min commute to work, so stopping by for lunch isn\u2019t really feasible. My sister has been kind enough to leave work and drive past a few times here and there, and she hasn\u2019t seen anything out of the ordinary.\n* We have a Ring camera at the front door, and I\u2019ve got the app on my phone with notifs on. Nothing there yet. If anyone has recommendations for more discreet surveillance, I\u2019d be open to it\u2014I\u2019m just the least tech-savvy person and worry another camera will be easy to detect lol\n\n\\*\\*Edit: And yes, we get our carbon monoxide detectors tested regularly.\"\n\n*Is it possible one of the hair clips came from daycare?*\n\n\"I could see the hair clip being a possibility, but less likely on the onesie. My younger daughter hadn\u2019t been to daycare in days, and if either of them had returned with something like that before I would\u2019ve noticed\u2014especially since it was the kind of onesie I hate with a passion lol.\"\n\n*People comment that they can't wait to find out the ending to this saga:*\n\n\"My money\u2019s on the Hollywood horror ending. Hopefully dreamed up the dogs too so I can finally stop picking up their imaginary shits and whatnot.\"\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Final Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/CapableElephant6355/comments/171tpzd/two_tampons_mean_my_marriage_is_over_final_update/)**: October 6, 2023 (16 days later)\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n**Title:** Two tampons mean my marriage is over\n\nAfter nearly losing my mind over a hair clip and a onesie, I realized I wasn\u2019t getting anywhere with the accusations and half-baked guesswork. I\u2019d gotten so absorbed in the paranoia and misery of my situation that I wasn\u2019t sleeping, eating, or caring for my kids the way I should have been. And I wasn't getting any answers. So I decided to pull the trigger on the hidden cameras and have them shipped to my sister\u2019s house, with my BIL agreeing to help with the install/setup over at mine. Before the cameras were ever delivered, though, I got my long-awaited confirmation last week.\n\nA Ring notification had alerted me to motion at the front door while I was at work. Half-expecting to see a delivery person, pet, or lawncare salesman for the fifteenth time, you can imagine my surprise when I saw a clip of a young woman leading my daughter into the house hand-in-hand, with my husband and other daughter close behind them. The girls were supposed to be in daycare and my husband at work. The woman, as far as I knew, was living two states away with a court order keeping her there.\n\nI immediately called my husband to ask him what the fuck this woman was doing in our house. He didn\u2019t answer, so I texted it to him. Even in his stupidity, he probably realized he had messed up by going through the front door, knew I had gotten the Ring notification, and wanted to delay the inevitable. By the fifth or sixth subsequent call, though, he did pick up.\n\nThe woman on the camera was my husband\u2019s sister. As I would come to find out later, she was the likely source of both tampons, the onesie, and the bow. She is also a registered sex offender and a recovering addict, who spent the better part of her adolescence and young adulthood coercing the silence of another one of my husband's family members after she had molested them. I hadn't seen or heard from her in years, and from the way my husband talked about her, I didn't expect I ever would. But here she was, in our house, with our children.\n\nSuffice to say I was livid. It wasn\u2019t an affair at all and still, somehow, infinitely more disgusting knowing who it was and *why* all of this had been happening. Apparently my SIL, fresh off another stint in rehab, had wanted to reconnect and make amends with people she'd hurt, and my husband was high on that list. My husband didn't want me to know or, worse, try and keep \"her family\" (our children) away from her, so they'd been meeting in secret\u2014often at our house when I was at work. They would enter through the garage, in my husband's car, so the Ring camera at the front door wouldn't tip me off. She spent the night on a weekend I had been on a business trip and slept in our bed. She babysat our girls on a night my husband told me he had dropped them off at his parents'. She bought the girls clothes and dressed my youngest in the onesie and bow that my husband had promised on his life I had dressed her in myself.\n\nMy husband *swore* this was all in my head. The tampons, the onesie, the bow, and all the rest. He was perfectly content to watch me agonize for weeks over a woman he insisted didn't exist. Shrugging off each progressively more unsettling discovery like it was news to him and telling me I was being irrational. He insinuated that I was experiencing postpartum depression\u2014two years after I'd given birth. Four years after I'd told him that one of my biggest fears for motherhood was to suffer PPD like my mother had with me, to not be fully present for our babies and be left with a world of guilt and regret as they grew older. He told me I wasn't sleeping enough, that I missed the girls too much, that I needed to take a step back and reevaluate the state of my mental health. I gave him the benefit of the doubt because he was my husband, and because no other version of events made sense. Now, after a month of this mindfuck, I have nothing to show for my trust but this pathetic situation. And a lot of anger.\n\n***Relevant Comment:***\n\n*Call the cops and a lawyer:*\n\n\"Already on it. Believe me, we\u2019re going scorched earth with this motherfucker.\"",

        "Body/Content": "#  \ud83c\udfae Game Stop \ud83d\uded1 Power to the Apes\n\n[You stay stonky, San Diago.](https://preview.redd.it/ki5gi2o2qk271.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=14d8d6340fdeaeb6a31770af0351c9a74b2c7338)\n\n# Moderator Promotions\n\nI am so very happy to announce that we have promoted two moderators to Full Permissions. This effectively puts them in the same moderator power level as u/rensole and u/redchessqueen99. While Reddit's hierarchy still remains the same, these two will now have access to Community Settings and Full Permissions, giving them the ability to adjust site settings, give moderator awards, add and remove mods, and much more, but overall will be seen as top authorities in the moderator team.\n\n* [u/Bye\\_Triangle](https://www.reddit.com/u/Bye_Triangle/)\n   * BT been with us since [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/) days (he wrote the r/GME FAQ) and has been a critical mod at r/Superstonk. His steadfast work ethic, dedication to the community, strong skills and relationships with the other mods, and his ethical stature are all key aspects of why we feel this promotion is warranted. He has also been very active in our mod chat, and has helped to keep the peace and mediate disagreements for the betterment of all mods and the community at large.\n* [u/Pinkcatsonacid](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pinkcatsonacid/)\n   * Pink has been dedicated to this subreddit since her addition as mod. She has become a beloved friend to many of us, and I think she brings invaluable insight and purpose to the mod team as well as the community. She has demonstrated her worth time and time again with tireless work ethic, dedication to the ape community, and close relationships that no doubt will strengthen them both as it emanates outward to the rest of us.\n\n[Apes Together Strong](https://preview.redd.it/uc3wcx5tok271.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bed62b2f34bf0426b372e99eafbcf9c8f5c4e4af)\n\nI think this could also mark an evolutionary transition for [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/) in terms of moderator structuring and the scope of the sub itself. When [u/rensole](https://www.reddit.com/u/rensole/) and I were at [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/), all mods had Full Permissions. This actually caused a lot of issues since some mods abused those permissions, and it effectively led to the migration from the sub. As a result, we have been very careful with who we give permissions to in an attempt to prevent catastrophe. It's worked so far, but we feel it is time to expand permissions to those deserving.\n\nu/Bye_Triangle and u/Pinkcatsonacid have tirelessly worked for the growth and integrity of r/Superstonk, and I have come to trust them and love them as fellow apes and friends in this journey. I have no qualms promoting them both to Full Permissions admin-level roles. We hope they can assist us heavily in acting as authorities for the sub and in leading the mod team and ape community as a whole into the future. This is very much deserved, so please make sure to give them serious congratulations. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e CONGRATULATIONS \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\n\n# MOASS Defense\n\nOver the past few months, as far back as my tenure at r/GME, there have been questions about the MOASS and how we would protect the sub in the event of a cataclysmic series of events. Ever since, we have been working with a special team of wrinkle-brained apes, and the mods, to develop a solution to this inevitable outcome.\n\nI am proud to announce that this solution is finally ready for implementation, and today it received a majority-vote from the r/Superstonk mod team, and is therefore approved and now being implemented.\n\nThis plan will address the following concerns:\n\n1. How will we defend against the onslaught of new members from the MOASS?\n2. How are we going to protect against incoming FUD attacks?\n3. How do we discourage a sub split effort?\n4. How do we allow those hurt by age/karma limits to remain included?\n5. What has Red been alluding to for the past two months?\n\nTo answer these concerns, we have worked diligently to come up with a multi-faceted plan that will no doubt secure the subreddit for the foreseen future. But first, I should introduce you to a little secret we mods have been keeping from you all... don't worry, we kept it secret for one particular and very important purpose: to study unsuspecting shills.\n\n[My cat on my laptop: \\\\\"I'm in.\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/7iomr9b6pk271.png?width=553&format=png&auto=webp&s=96e57d4a390575613e487e76ff99d68e41c03d36)\n\nP**lease read this message:**\n\nGreetings to all Ape-Kind! I\u2019m u/grungromp.\n\nStrap in. We\u2019ve got a lot of text to get through.\n\nBack in March, some Apes who have some brain wrinkles about behavior got together with some Apes who know how to use computers real good to try and develop a method of countering the invasion of nefarious actors trying to spread FUD to our community. We contacted the mods on r/gme to see if the project would be of worth and u/redchessqueen99 responded with emphatic support. Upon the Great Ape Migration to r/Superstonk, she invited us to continue our work with her direct involvement here.\n\nWith the behind the scenes view we were given of the sub, we\u2019ve been working over the past three months to put together a system of shill detection. We wanted this to be the proverbial headshot, and needed to make sure we limited collateral damage to Apes, while also not giving shills time to adapt. We sincerely wish we\u2019d been able to be faster about it, but we were literally generating this project from the ground up, as (to our awareness) no one has ever attempted something like this before, or even had the need to.\n\nBefore we describe the project, we\u2019d like to offer you a bit of insight into what we\u2019ve been seeing with the sub over the past week to establish the need, if it hasn\u2019t already been obvious to the average Ape.\n\nThe age and karma restrictions were originally put into place on r/superstonk on April 25. This prohibited comments from accounts under 30 days old, and posts from accounts under 60. We realized this meant that on May 25th, accounts that had been created on and around the day the restrictions were put in place would be able to start a massive FUD campaign.\n\nWe were right.\n\nIn the last week, the amount of accounts posting in the sub whom we have been able to identify as shills has increased at least 8 times. Where we were seeing 3 in 100 suspicious looking posts and accounts at times previously, over the past week that number has jumped to 24 in 100.\n\nWith that in mind, we have decided that now is the moment to make our stand.\n\nWe\u2019d like to introduce you all to **Satori**.\n\n[Shorting shills since 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/072qgrnnck271.png?width=2084&format=png&auto=webp&s=791923e8726db74fc069a80ad400717cc306b1b0)\n\nOne of the greatest advantages the hedge funds have had over us during this entire process is the ability to manipulate the market by using technology that we don\u2019t have access to. High frequency trading and algorithms have put a pretty massive finger on the scales to tip the markets in their favor. That is why we feel that Satori is so important and could be such a boon to the Ape community. This evens the playing field, giving us the advantage of advanced technological analysis on our home court. In essence, this allows us to \u201cShort the Shills.\u201d They have no idea that this is coming. And they are not prepared.\n\nA few points of import about Satori and it\u2019s capabilities\n\n* As with our analysis of GME as a stock, Satori functions almost entirely with publicly available information. Every possible publicly seen feature of Reddit is included to some degree. While we do utilize some privileged information from the Moderation team, that is the extent of our data gathering. We do not have access to private chats, ip addresses, or anything that is not available to public view.\n* Satori is designed to analyze every single poster in r/Superstonk and generate a confidence interval of how likely they are to be a shill. The higher the score, the more likely the account is a shill. That information will be given to the Mods in order to inform their plans and decision making. It will not be public information. However, it is important to note that the system is designed to identify bad actors based on their actions. Just because an account hasn't posted anything shilly YET doesn't mean they never will. Therefore, a low \u201cShill Score\u2122\u201d is not considered a guarantee of Ape-ness. Do not assume that anyone posting has been granted an \u201call clear.\u201d\n* As is the case with all human activity, shilling isn\u2019t a black and white issue. There is a chance of error on both ends, both shills that will go undetected as well as real Apes who are flagged as suspicious. It\u2019s a truth that we\u2019re aware of, and we\u2019ve taken as much time as we could to be as accurate as possible. We have worked with the mod team and recommended several steps for mitigating this after implementation.\n\n[ Satori \\(\u899a, \\\\\"consciousness\\\\\"\\) in Japanese folklore are mind-reading monkey-like monsters \\(\\\\\"y\u014dkai\\\\\"\\) said to dwell within the mountains of Hida and Mino. ](https://preview.redd.it/cyfxillrgk271.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1983c2fbefe8b7fb1d54224ea47687d86869ba8)\n\n* Satori is NOT designed to detect and identify negative sentiment toward GME. It is NOT designed to shut down criticism of the stock or DD. It is NOT simply a method to amplify any echo chamber effect. Continue to doubt, research, and criticize, as has been the mantra of our community since its inception. Our only aim is to contribute to making r/Superstonk a platform where Apes can freely discuss GME and share memes by counteracting bad actors who want to disrupt our community for nefarious purposes.\n* We are aware that transparency and sharing of information is an essential part of the Ape community. However, we are not going to be revealing the specifics of our tech, nor the metrics which it uses to analyze the content of the sub. This information may come out eventually, likely post MOASS, but if we were to give specifics in order to make an appeal to the idea of transparency, we would be handing a manual to the shills on exactly how to behave to hide from our mind reading monkey machine. Please understand that Satori has been tested and vetted in hundreds of iterations to arrive at this point, and that the Mods have seen and approved of our methods and will keep oversight over every change and decision.\n* We will leave it to u/redchessqueen99 and the mod group to describe the implementation process and how the technology will be utilized. But know that our team\u2019s tits are jacked to levels unheard of before at the fact that we finally get to deploy our virtual psychic primate.\n\n[ \\\\\"I see... I see... I see a lot of shadow marketing companies freaking out.\\\\\" ](https://preview.redd.it/31z3goqzgk271.jpg?width=343&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b77ee83ae72fca8accdb3bd9ca0c96b4ccf1829)\n\nWhile we have yet to use Satori for sweeping changes on the sub, the mod team has already utilized it at various points. In smaller instances, Satori has already been used to see and identify FUD campaigns, target suspicious users, and plan specific moves and posts within the community. While those instances have been helpful, we recognize the potential for what Satori is capable of is so much greater, and now is our time to utilize it to it\u2019s capacity.\n\nWith all that new information presented to you, we do have one small request. This is brand new. There will be some bumps along the way. We\u2019ve done our best to see and plan for every possible outcome, but we are aware that we will have missed some things. It will be a bit messy as we get things up and running. You have our promise that we will continue to refine our processes and do whatever is needed to ensure this community has the protection it deserves in the face of what we\u2019re dealing with.\n\nWe don\u2019t mean to wax hyperbolic, but this may be one of the most powerful pieces of technology developed in history that deals specifically with community analysis and management. It\u2019s been grassroots created by Apes, for Apes, and, to our knowledge, no one else has ever developed anything like this. Apes are now in possession of an asset that gives us autonomy and power that few other online communities have ever come close to harnessing. We\u2019ve taken punch after punch from the hedgies; shills, infiltrators, propaganda, media manipulation, and market manipulation. Our team could not be more proud of the way this incredible community has taken every blow and got back to our hairy, prehensile feet.\n\nBut now? We have a way to counter punch. Hard.  And we will do it with a nuke dropped off our rocket as we leave Earth\u2019s atmosphere on our way to the stars.\n\nIn the words of Ryan Cohen: R.I.P. Dumb Asses\n\nApes Strong Together\n\nBuy. Hodl. Vote. Fight.\n\n\\---\n\n**Note from** u/redchessqueen99\\*\\*:\\*\\*\n\nSatori was created and developed by a team that was largely kept private for over two months now. This team includes [u/catto\\_del\\_fatto](https://www.reddit.com/u/catto_del_fatto/),  [u/grungromp](https://www.reddit.com/u/grungromp/), and [u/Captain-Fan](https://www.reddit.com/u/Captain-Fan/). I have personally worked with them since before the r/Superstonk migration from r/GME, and can say they have become some of my most trusted friends.\n\nu/catto_del_fatto was also added awhile back as a mod to incorporate moderator-level data into the information-gathering aspects of Satori, thus allowing the mod team to talk to him directly and help provide shill data for the system. Catto has officially accepted a full-time mod role with general moderator permissions, and we are looking forward to continuing this project and fostering a deeper relationship between the Satori team and the moderator team.\n\nTL;DR: r/Superstonk has an intelligence division.\n\n[Asta la vista, baby.](https://preview.redd.it/nechp7j0dk271.jpg?width=2400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd6ba796a7eef2dc785b89595ae5bdf855969ffd)\n\n# The Plan\n\n* **Increase karma and age filters**\n   * Posts : 60 days / 500 karma ---> 120 days / 2000 karma\n      * Accounts will need have been created earlier than February 1, 2021\n   * Comments: 30 days / 250 karma ---> 60 days / 500 karma\n      * Accounts will need to have been created earlier than April 1, 2021\n      * Note: Superstonk Migration was April 4, 2021\n   * These limits will need to scale as time progresses; until the MOASS; while we hone and implement this program for total effectiveness.\n   * These limits will be implemented on June 1, 2021 sometime throughout the day.\n* **Activate** ***Satori***\n   * The immediate goal of Satori is to make sure that true apes are not locked out due to the increased restrictions. However, bans are an automated capability.\n   * \"Mod-bots\" will be added to the mod team and given approve and ban permissions, and then programmed to automate the approval or ban process via a generated list of users.\n   * u/Satori-Blue-Shell is currently the only mod-bot added and is actively Approving members\n   * APPROVALS - All users who were created after the Blip (end of January) and are not on the high risk list of users, with be added to the Approved Users in waves. By being added as Approved Users, they will bypass the karma and age filters. This will actively allow MORE true apes to participate in the sub.\n   * BANS - Mods will receive spreadsheets of high risk users, where they can approve or deny users, and then these lists will be implemented for automated implementation.\n* **Mods will officially now be allowed to Approve users they trust in addition to Satori**\n   * Previously, we did not allow approving users because we suspected some foul play associated with that. Now, however, due to the sheer volume of approvals, we feel confident that we can add this to our arsenal of methods to protect apes in r/Superstonk.\n* **Minimize Fallout**\n   * This plan prioritizes the positive aspects of Satori over the negative, and allows mod oversight on the bans process. Halting Satori is as simple as removing permissions from the mod-bot.\n   * Many of you who couldn't post due to age and karma limits, will now  will be able to, once added to the Approved Users list. If you are not added, please be patient, as we are currently approving in waves.\n   * This will incentivize good behavior, because apes will not want to lose their approved status, or will want to earn it in the first place. Overall, we are essentially making it harder to post and comment on Superstonk, and then rewarding loyal apes with approvals that allow them to post or comment without any restrictions.\n   * Therefore, I am convinced this will make r/Superstonk a better experience for true apes, while making it a nightmare for the imposters and shills.\n\n*Please note that Satori does not have access to private chats, discords, or other private aspects of your account and it is currently limited to Reddit. We only scan publicly available content as well as what can be seen from a moderator perspective, which primarily includes removed posts and comments. We respect your privacy, and are merely utilizing the same levels of intel used against us to even the playing field.*\n\n[Shillpocalypse \\(by u\\/grungromp\\)](https://preview.redd.it/broy2hwpck271.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4e50c469e37c5bb980c02927d5ed0bb10f0b761)\n\nWith two new admin-level mods to help keep oversight, and with such an incredible software creation by the Satori team, we are poised to not only defend against the constant FUD, shills, and MOASS popularity, but also to remain a secure and reliable source of knowledge sharing - forever.\n\nI don't want to say we will never end up like r/wallstreetbets ... but we'll never end up like r/wallstreetbets.

Harvest losses to offset gains perpetually, and then use estate planning loopholes to pass on the wealth.\n\n[That's how Mitt Romney effectively paid 14% in taxes despite capital gains being taxed at a higher 15%.

If Joe Biden is serious about raising revenue to fund his massive spending bills, the only serious way of doing that is by raising taxes on the middle and upper-middle class.

        "Title": "My PS5 seems to be bricked after an hour of play :(",
        "Body/Content": "I was able to play around an hour of Astro until the controller randomly disconnected and refused to sync back to the console (it just flashed blue lights when I pressed PS, and hooking it up via cable didn't help). So I just went for the classic troubleshooting step of turning the console off and on again. I pressed the console power button and it came up with the screen of shutting down/putting it to sleep (I can't remember which).\n\nThen I just pressed power again to turn it back on... at first it beeped once like it should... but then nothing else at all. No lights, no fan, nothing. It just beeped. I've unplugged it from the wall for a good half an hour and tried plugging it into a different wall socket, tried my old PS4 power cable, no good either. And it's not even beeping now, it just seems completely dead.\n\nI couldn't find anyone else with this issue yet, which isn't surprising, though I did see some old PS4 posts about beeps with no power, and that seemed to be a faulty power supply. I've contacted the store I bought it from and was advised it'll be at least 2-3 weeks for a replacement. :( Been on hold to Sony for over half an hour so far, but don't have much hope there.\n\nHoping no one else gets this problem but yeah, thought I'd post it anyway.\n\nEdit: It's the disc version. Was on hold to Playstation Australia support for over an hour and then it hung up... trying again. It stopped beeping at all for a while, but now it's back to beeping once when I try to power it on sometimes. Sometimes the eject button still beeps three times. Just seems nothing else is getting power.\n\nEdit2: Before it died completely, I did get a VERY brief \"rebuilding database\" screen on an earlier reboot, might have been after copying some PS4 games to the PS5 via local LAN.\n\nEdit3: I was on hold to Playstation Australia support for over 3 hours and couldn't get through (call cut after 1 hour, called back and it cut after 2 hours). Their call centre is closed now so I'll have to try again in the morning. I tried live chat and they told me I had to call. .\\_. Oh and I can't enter safe mode, I never get the second beep no matter how long I hold it down, 0 signs of life. He's dead, Jim.\n\nEdit4: Yeah I've tried all kinds of combinations of pressing the power while it's plugged in/unplugged, and also just leaving it plugged in/unplugged for hours to no avail. I really appreciate all the advice and kind comments though, helped take the sting out of the day. I'll be calling Sony again in the morning.\n\nTo those worrying before they get their PS5 - don't. I only posted this cause I couldn't find anyone else with my issue. Every new tech has some amount of duds, I didn't mean for this post to blow up. If you want to be really cautious, maybe just be a bit careful with PS4>PS5 LAN transfers or external HDs and just grab things from the PSN/cloud saves for now until you see if there's anything to the 'rebuilding database' theories. I'm leaning towards me just ~~losing~~ winning the dud lottery. Go die lots in Demon's Souls for me. (:\n\nEdit5: I finally managed to get through to Sony's Aussie support lines this morning (no 3hr queue), but they didn't have good news. The standard RMA process of 2-3+ weeks is all they could offer (no super secret stock for DOA replacements), and he didn't seem very interested in learning about the fault. So instead I took it back to the store (EB Games Australia), and was pleasantly surprised that they already ordered a new one in for me after I called yesterday. While they're quoted up to 14 business days for it to arrive, he's hopeful it'll be in some time next week. Fingers crossed.\n\nBonus lame size comparison pic just because: [https://imgur.com/a/XjyLan2](https://imgur.com/a/XjyLan2)\n\nEdit6: Some people wanted a video so here you go, it's not very exciting: [https://youtu.be/uIHuufHyJt4](https://youtu.be/uIHuufHyJt4)\n\nEdit7: Final update (I hope). The store actually did manage to get a new replacement in for me by the end of the week. Got the call near 6pm on the Friday, almost gave up hope. Big props to EB Games Australia for getting it in so quick. If I went with Sony I'd probably still be waiting another week or two. Been putting hours into Demon's Souls, all working good so far. See you in Boletaria. (:\n\n\\---\n\ntl;dr: Played fine for an hour, controller lost sync, turned PS5 off an on again... only the 'on' part no longer works :(",

        "Title": "Dear r/all and people just now tuning into the Gamestop saga...",
        "Body/Content": "\nFirst off, welcome to Superstonk. I know we can be a bit intimidating upon first impression, but I promise that you'll fit right in once you get to know us. \n\nSecond, you're probably wondering what all of this Gamestop stuff is about right? You've seen it on the front page, in the news, and spoken about in your friend circles, but you still don't quite get it. You're here for a quick elevator pitch to get you up to speed. \n\nSo that's what this post is going to do. I'll lead you to the rabbit hole, but it's up to you if you want to dive in afterwards. \n\nTo begin, you need to start thinking of Gamestop as an emerging tech-focused startup company. This startup has over 1.5 billion dollars in cash on hand, it has no significant debt, and it has a user base of 50 million subscribers in their power up rewards program. \n\nDecent numbers right? Now that I have your attention, I'm happy to tell you that this new startup is being led by an activist investor named Ryan Cohen. Who is Ryan Cohen you might ask. All you need to know is that he's someone who has already proven his ability to disrupt industries and outperform giants like Amazon by using customer experience as the cornerstone for success. His philosophy: Delight your customers with exceptional experiences and you drive shareholder value.\n\nYou've probably heard of Gamestop referred to as a failing brick and mortar store. What you probably haven't heard, is just how far from the truth that statement really is. Gamestop has already successfully transitioned to ecommerce in the midst of a global pandemic, they've set up massive coast to coast fulfillment warehouses, opened a large homegrown customer service center in the US, and expanded their strategic HQs in tech-focused cities around the country. That small time physical video game retailer you used to know from your childhood? It doesn't exist any more. It's grown the fuck up. \n\nThey're not just scaling up in terms of fulfillment and CX, they're also scaling up in terms of the sheer volume of products and SKUs now being offered. From a merchandizing perspective, they now support collectibles, clothing, PC hardware/accessories, and thousands of other products. They've more than doubled their product offerings in the past year alone. This is already having a positive impact on the increase in total revenue being reported on a quarterly basis. \n\nIf I don't have your attention yet, now would be a good time to mention the fact that in the past year, they've poached over 300 inidividuals from some of the world's biggest companies. Many of these individuals were holding senior management or executive level positions at companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, Chewy, BestBuy, etc. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't be leaving a decade long career at Amazon or Google to work for a medium cap failing brick and mortar store. Whatever Ryan Cohen is pitching these people, it must be compelling enough for them to leave a high level position and see it as the opportunity of a lifetime (direct quote from many of the new hires). Not to mention the fact that a majority of these new hires chose to accept stock compensation instead of a typical salary. \n\nAmazing right? Oh, and lest we forget, Gamestop is currently working on an NFT Marketplace that has the potential to completely disrupt an emerging multi billion dollar industry. You've probably heard at least a little about NFTs in the past couple months. Just know that Gamestop is poised to bring the NFT world to a mainstream audience with their 50 million power up rewards members. With loopring as their layer 2 partner, they will literally create a new paradigm shift for the mass adoption of web3. Power to the players, power to the creators, power to the collectors. \n\nSpeaking of power, you know how all these CEOs like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg have been selling off billions of their own stock within the last few months? Well our boy Ryan Cohen hasn't sold a single share. In fact, the vast majority of GME insiders are Hodling or buying more. That's some serious power in the face of an upcoming market crash. \n\nNow that we've laid out the fundamentals, let's toss a cherry on top shall we? \n\nShorts still haven't covered. \n\nI know what you're thinking. Yes, it is literally insane. In fact, short interest is estimated to be orders of magnitude larger than it was last January during the initial run up. For the past year mainstream media has been spreading false information to the average investor in an attempt to control the narrative. So we're busy taking things into our own hands by direct registering our shares in our own names. \n\nBut this is where I'm going to have to leave you for now. If any of the above has piqued your interest, you'll need to take the initiative to dive down the rabbit hole and see for yourself what this community has uncovered over the past year of peer-reviewed research. \n\nBut before I go, I want to leave you with this final thought. If shorts had actually closed their positions and Gamestop is just a failing brick and mortar store, why the fuck does the media spend so much airtime, effort, and resources discussing why retail investors need to forget about Gamestop?\n\n\n\nEdit 1: couple typos\n\nEdit 2: holy awards batman.\n\nEdit 3: removed tldr",

Almost every person of color, woman, or queer presenting person on the promo materials has either quit or never worked there in the first place) \n\n I answered honestly in front of a small group \"Well, there are two women in technical roles, and as one of them it sometimes feels like working two jobs. One as an engineer, and one as the 'token girl engineer' who gets pulled away from work for every photo op, or recruiting event. Honestly, if you like being a trailblazer and are prepared to take on the extra unspoken PR as the \"girl engineer', you might find a role here fulfilling, but if you prefer keeping your head down to focus on the technical side, it is easier to do that at a company where there is more gender and racial diversity.\n\nShe appreciated my honestly but the manager who was running the event told me to leave. I have a meeting with HR and my manager tomorrow. I don't think my opinion will be any news to them as I've already told them I'm not interested in being assigned to photo ops or recruiting disproportionately because of my gender, and I've been told that it's \"important\" for me to be there to help recruit a more diverse staff since the company is trying to improve. \n\nI feel like they're mad that I said the quiet part out loud at the recruiting event... But it was a honest answer to the question, and I keep on being brought to these things for my \"unique perspective\" and whatnot.\n\nI think they might also see themselves as doing something good, trying to do outreach to a more diverse applicant pool, and see me as ruining that. \n\nAITA for what I said about my job?\n\n---(UPADTE AFTER THE MEETING)---\n\nEdit - I had the meeting. I recorded it with their consent even though that was hard to come to an agreement on.\n\nI basically said that as I understood it, they had asked me to recruit because they want more female applicants and felt I could help recruit in a way the men on the team wouldn't. And that they wanted me there to share my unique perspective as a woman in the feild, is that correct?\n\nMy manager and HR confirmed that. \n\nI said that that role is often referred to as a \"trailblazer\" but is also often referred to as a \"token\" of a certain gender or race. But either way, the role was to publicly present the diversity of the company. And as I understood it, that was a part of my role, as mandated by management. To assist them in recruiting other women. \n\nI said I was asked about my experience by a potential applicant, and I answered in what I felt was a honest way. Saying\n\n- There are two women here\n\n- I feel that on top of a technical role, my role here as a woman is to be a trailblazer or token for other women. \n\n- If that dual role appeals to you, this would be a good fit. If a purely technical role appeals to you, this may not be a good fit. \n\nI see this as similar to how other recruiters say \"this is a very fast paced role, if you enjoy that role you would be a good fit but if you do not, you may not be.\" And I was wondering why I had been called to meet when other employees who had described the role and the sort of person they want to fill the role, have not been. \n\nThe HR guy said that \"token\" was often seen as having a negative connotation and I was deterring applicants\n\nI said that \"fast paced\" is also seen as negative to people with outside obligations, for example. And I didn't understand why being frank about the nature of my role was a problem. In fact, recruiters are often encouraged to be frank to attract candidates who are genuinely good matches. It would help attract the sort of woman who would like to be a \"token female engineer\" and deter the type of woman who would not. \n\nMy manager got frustrated and raised his voice to say \"NOBODY WANTS TO BE A TOKEN!\" And honestly I just looked at him with a \"no shit\" face but said \"That doesn't really track with your previous comments, you've frequently said that I should be proud to represent the company, and that I am much needed at these events. It sounded like you see it as an admirable and much appreciated role.\" \n\nHe said I was being \"a smartass\" and I said \"I apologize but I'm frustrated by a number of the contradictions in the messaging around this role. That I should be frank about the job expectations to recruit good fitting candidates, however I should not be frank about my personal job expectations? Despite never having that been communicated to me? \n\nHearing that I should be proud and happy to represent the company as a female engineer to attract other women? But then hearing that nobody wants to be in my shoes and that if I describe my role I will deter applicants? \n\nTo hear that the company is making efforts towards diversity, however that effort doesn't seem to continue to retention, as this year, four female employees quit, two were hired and then rapidly quit... This is a retention rate far lower than average. \n\nI'm frankly confused by what my role in this company is. Do you want an engineer or do you want a token? \n\nMy manager snapped at me and said that I am an engineer. I said \"I would like my job duties to reflect that\" \n\nThe HR guy said that I wouldn't be permitted to publicly represent the company anymore. I said okay. (Very not mad at that...)\n\nSo... I feel like my manager is pissed off, but I'm well along in the interview process with several other companies. So hopefully that won't be a problem anymore. I'm not quitting till I have a new offer signed but I'm not too concerned if I get fired and get unemployment",

        "Title": "r/curlyhair makes it a rule you have to be a certain race to use terms like 'big chop'",
        "Body/Content": "I wasn't going to post this originally, but when someone asked me why I hadn't posted it already I decided to finally share this story on my former favorite subreddit:\n\nIt all started with the typical wavy vs curly hair debate. In the sub, your hair is considered curly if it has any texture to it, including the slightest wave. There is a rule, \u201cno curly gatekeeping.\u201d An OP complained that there is curly gatekeeping on Twitter, as if this was news. Seriously, anywhere but in r/curlyhair it is generally accepted that your hair has to have a certain curl to be curly.\n\n>[if your hair doesn't go into spirals, it's not curly. The wavy community NEEDS to come to terms with that](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/csf0eh/tried_to_look_into_2c_curl_tips_on_twitter_and/).\n\nThis post was met by a comment detailing how the subreddit is actually unwelcoming to black women because\n\n>[\u201cwhen it comes to black women speaking on their own personal movement (the natural hair movement) you guys tend to step in where you\u2019re not needed... to people on the outside, when Black women do what the woman in the tweet did, it can seem like gatekeeping, but i urge you guys to realize that Black women have always been kept out of things that seem basic to you guys... it\u2019s even more exhausting to enter a place that claims to be for everyone with curly/textured hair, but still feel like an outsider when you see people try to downplay (and sometimes ignore) discrimination that you know you and everyone who looks like you faces.\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/csf0eh/tried_to_look_into_2c_curl_tips_on_twitter_and/exfbhcf?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nThus the mods decided to recruit new moderators to address the lack of diversity in the sub, specifically why black women don't post to the sub. My name is no longer on the [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/faks7v/meta_welcome_new_moderators/) but my proof is all the [mod flairs](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/fwyf2z/maybe_no_one_will_see_but_still_doing_cgm_for/fmufq4d?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) I used in the past. The mods asked me about my thoughts and pretty much ignored them.\n\nThe misuse of big chop is mentioned in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/faks7v/meta_welcome_new_moderators/fjhka2f?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). Everyone on the sub uses their own definition of big chop, whether it is a long hair to shoulder length hair cut or longer than 3 inches. But in the natural hair community, it means going from relaxing curly hair straight to cutting off all the relaxed hair \u2013 you're left with a few inches at most and skipped transitioning into your natural hair texture. I was on board for correcting the sub about this term and educating people about the natural hair movement.\n\nSo the mods made this [post about education](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/ffexc7/meta_an_open_conversation_an_open_dialogue/). I wrote the parts referencing a book. The post talked about how POC suffer through discrimination because of their hair. Originally, this post talked nothing about you needing to be black in order to use these terms, it's been edited since then.\n\nOne person talked about having their hair called \u201cwhite girl curly\u201d\n\n>[\u201cI was talking about it to a friend of mine who happens to be a WoC and she seemed almost angry to hear me talk about it and told me my hair was \u201cwhite person curly\u201d and then that it \u201cwasn\u2019t even curly.\u201d Not going to lie, I was hurt by this because I was happy to feel confident in my hair again and then was wondering if I should even feel happy about it anymore.\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/ffexc7/meta_an_open_conversation_an_open_dialogue/fk51fas?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nwhich someone replied that:\n\n>[\u201cHowever, to say your hair is \"white girl curly\" to invalidate your curls is borderline racism, and that person seems like an asshole for belittling your happiness.\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/ffexc7/meta_an_open_conversation_an_open_dialogue/fkxh2vz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).\n\nThere's more arguments, like\n\n>[\u201caccept wavy hair for being wavy, instead of mislabeling your hair type\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/ffexc7/meta_an_open_conversation_an_open_dialogue/fk0roqx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).\n\nAnd someone tells it how it is:\n\n>[\u201cThis talk about inclusion and diversity is like tech companies and elite liberal arts colleges who use their diversity as a selling point to raise their status and appeal. I'm here to look at pictures of hair, not talk about cultural appropriation.\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/ffexc7/meta_an_open_conversation_an_open_dialogue/fk2p4li?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).\n\nAnd this one between a mod and a user\n\n>[\u201cI disagree... the words curly, natural, and chopped are common descriptive words in the English language. They don't belong to any one group. Now, I would not use the particular phrase \"natural hair journey\" or certain hash tags as they do have very specific connotations. However, I draw the line at basic descriptors. I am very sorry if that seems disrespectful. From my perspective it seems disrespectful to others to claim basic descriptive words.\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/ffexc7/_/fk50o9e/)  \n>  \n>[\u201cThis is all just incredibly rude and disrespectful of you and that was a weak non-apology. I hope that you will keep up with the coming posts and come to understand that diversity, inclusion, and minimizing microaggressions/cultural appropriation\\* is important and change your views.\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/ffexc7/_/fk51alg/)  \n>  \n>[\u201cPlease explain to me exactly what I have said that is rude or disrespectful. I have tried very hard to be sympathetic and respectful and if you could clarify for me what is offending i would be very interested... I am ethnically Irish. For my ethnicity and culture natural curly hair is a well known and admired part of it. Why is it ok to disregard my ethnicity and culture in order to respect your's? Or Jewish curlies, or Greek/Mediterranean curlies, or Arabic curlies? There has to be a better option.\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/ffexc7/_/fk5mjar/)  \n>  \n>[\u201cYou weren't disrespectful, she's just a sensitive SJW snowflake\u201d](https://www.removeddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/ffexc7/_/fkeb991/)\n\nAnd someone who caught on that this open discussion wasn't very open\n\n>[\u201cI will definately withhold any action or judgement to see what you and the rest of the moderators do. I was under the impression that this was an open discussion. If the decision is already made I am not sure what the point of this thread was... I certainly would not have stated my opinion or opened myself up to backlash had I known the decisions were already made. I hope this feeling I am getting is mistaken and everything turns out well for every one.\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/ffexc7/meta_an_open_conversation_an_open_dialogue/fk5mzoa?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nBlack hair is political\n\n>[\u201cnon black people that have \u201cstruggled\u201d with frizzy hair or whatever have every right to admire the curly girl movement, but the struggle of black people is on a WHOLE other level: it\u2019s economic and political. white people, regardless of how curly their hair is, have never been economically discriminated against because of their hair. Sure they may have been bullied and that\u2019s valid, but they shouldn\u2019t be the face of the movement. They can sympathize and stand in solidarity, but the mods/posts here being majority non-POC is a huge issue and inaccurate representation of the people. no one is gatekeeping curly hair, any race can have it. but the representation of the movement SHOULD be \u201cgate-kept\u201d in a way. you can\u2019t have majority white people being the face of a natural POC hair movement because they don\u2019t know the struggle. I for one am a POC with wavy hair, I don\u2019t claim it to be curly. I don\u2019t take up space talking about the \u201cstruggles of acceptance\u201d I faced or whatever the fuck. I take care of my hair using advice from this sub and other ones. I don\u2019t try to pretend I know what it\u2019s likely to have Afro-textured hair. It\u2019s not my place. I stand in solidarity with the movement, but it\u2019s not mine to lead or dominate. I think the mods/others on this sub who say \u201cblack people are gatekeeping curly hair!!\u201d need to see that.\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/ffexc7/meta_an_open_conversation_an_open_dialogue/fjyeyk1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nThere's more drama there if you want to look for it. And the [removeddit is here](https://www.removeddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/ffexc7/meta_an_open_conversation_an_open_dialogue/).\n\nNot much there wasn't removed quickly but there is this:\n\n>[\u201cI will probably get a lot of backlash for this comment. I am white and have wavy hair. I personally do not feel a white woman with curly hair shouldn\u2019t be able to call her hair curly. Because that\u2019s what it is. Yes, POC often have different hair types and textures than a white woman, and I have extreme empathy and sadness for the struggles and discrimination they have endured and do endure still. No white woman will ever fully be able to understand those struggles I\u2019m sure. I do however believe that curly hair is a hair type that any race can have. Just because someone\u2019s hair is curlier doesn\u2019t make yours less curly. The natural hair movement is all yours, I get that. But curls are for everyone.\u201d](https://www.removeddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/ffexc7/_/fls5nwv/)\n\nThe mods began commenting on people's posts that mentioned big chop in the title. This action was [noticed](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/fu5vya/why_all_the_hate_about_a_big_chop/).\n\nThen came this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/fuwavw/meta_rule_changes_for_inclusivity_include/) which made respecting cultural terms a rule and included an [infograph](https://i.imgur.com/a1fdnBW.png) on whether your haircut is a big chop or not, and at the end it asked if you were a POC. I was now confused, none of the mods told me we were going to moderate race. When I mentioned this was not going to be well received they told me we'll cross that bridge when we get there. I didn't think the last question was necessary. And I was not the only one, like the top comment\n\n>[\u201cDoesn't that seem counterproductive though and unfair? I personally am all for educating, but find something like this to just be general gatekeeping.\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/fuwavw/meta_rule_changes_for_inclusivity_include/fmyyxkz?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).\n\nAnd upon further talking with the mods people began to notice this wasn't about POC,\n\n>[\u201cI think it\u2019s very important that any latinx and nonblack POC know that according to this comment, the mod discussion surrounding inclusion was never for us. Our exclusion is not a consideration at this time.\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/fuwavw/meta_rule_changes_for_inclusivity_include/fmx60c3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).\n\nYou see, the mods made the mistake of saying POC as an abbreviation of black people so when it was pointed out by this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/fuwavw/meta_rule_changes_for_inclusivity_include/fms8gvt?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), the mods scrambled to change everything that mentioned POC to black people and changed the infograph's last question to \u201cDo you have black ancestry?\u201d Even I was confused, and I was a mod that read the mod chat on Slack every day. I wouldn't have made that mistake but it was never made clear to me that the whole diversity conversation was only about black people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>[\u201cIf after years of racism and discrimination that lead to issues of with self worth and self love, someone with 4b hair that\u2019s been relaxed to the point of no return decides to cut off all their hair to make the radical statement that your hair is naturally beautiful without confirming to Eurocentric standards, then is that a big chop or is that a haircut?](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/fuwavw/meta_rule_changes_for_inclusivity_include/fmxeat9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)  \n>  \n>[\u201cThat is a hair cut.

John F. Kennedy said that a rising tide lifts all boats. That was more of an economic metaphor but it can apply here.

Big chop has been used by women all over the planet to mean chopping off a large amount of hair. Anyone, ANYONE telling another person they can't use 'natural hair' nor 'big chop' is an absolute moron. I do not care what anyone's race is but stating those words are \"culturally sensitive\" is a crock. Calling a Negro the \"n\" word is wrong, calling a Caucasian the \"c\" word is wrong and so forth and so on with the other three human races but saying you had a big chop cause you cut off 12 inches of hair is not wrong no matter your race.\"Hair journey\" is one of the more dumb terms I've heard. To journey one must move from one place to another. Not flat ironing your hair is not a journey. Letting your hair stay curly is not a journey. Doing anything to your hair is not a journey.\"](https://www.removeddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/fuwavw/_/fnq6fzx/)\n\nThe [removeddit is here](https://www.removeddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/fuwavw/meta_rule_changes_for_inclusivity_include/). Great removed quotes there like:\n\n>[\u201cThis is fucking pathetic.

I see it as a form of welcoming and acceptance. \u201cCultural appropriation\u201d has gone too far in my opinion. In generations to follow, we\u2019re all going to start looking like each other, especially in the melting pot of America. We should celebrate being one culture of humans with curly hair!

They spent a lot of time making rebuttals to people and asking one of the new mods for input for each comment. They claimed their implementation was open to change but everyone who said just remove the part about needing to be black was told no. When I talked about discrimination in latinx communities, the mods said they couldn't fix it and would not give the same shout out they gave black people to latinx, instead pushing that latinx has anti-blackness as well.\n\nThis has already led to some cringe. [Like an OP telling the mods they are African and light-skinned when the mods corrected OP about using big chop](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/fz8g3p/please_help_anybody_has_an_idea_why_my_hair_grows/fn3jpan?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).\n\nAnd someone told a different OP after the mods corrected OP:\n\n>[\u201cAs a black woman, most of us have no problem with you using that term\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/g38m98/curls_coming_back_to_life_after_a_big_chop/fnrirgv?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\nCensorship is pretty bad in r/curlyhair, your comment can be removed for telling the mods [they are full of it](https://www.removeddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/g38m98/curls_coming_back_to_life_after_a_big_chop/) or really just for disagreeing tbh.\n\nMore stuff about the ongoing curly gatekeeping here:\n\n>[\u201cFriendly reminder that being a curly impostor isn't a thing and curly gatekeeping isn't productive. This post is brought to you by those gatekeepy tik toks\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/fxsml7/friendly_reminder_that_being_a_curly_impostor/)\n\nAnd the removedit is [here](https://www.removeddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/fxsml7/friendly_reminder_that_being_a_curly_impostor/).\n\nSo why am I not a mod anymore? At the risk of posting drama I'm involved with, I'll try to keep it short and neutral. I decided to finally voice my concerns, that this was getting a bit racist and that we shouldn't moderate race. At first, they didn't seem to understand why I was against it even though I could use the terms as someone with black ancestry. They then told me that racism was about power and that you can't be racist towards white people. When they asked me to define racism, I showed them the dictionary definition of racism, to which I was told, \u201cYou know how many racists show me that everyday?\u201d And then one of the main two mods told me to talk only to her since it was too painful to two of the new mods to hear from me (one of them is inactive, I had forgotten they were a mod). After reciting a bunch of pre-made responses, she repeatedly asked me \u201cwhy is racism so bad?\u201d and  shot down every reason I gave as wrong even when I started linking articles about racism. She said this is no different than not allowing people with straight hair to post on r/curlyhair although my stance was as long as it is on topic it should be fine. When I asked about the black people who said they wanted this, the only direct feedback I was given was from one of the new mod's discord. I didn't actually see any PMs from black people wanting this. And when I said not all black people want this, I was told that I was cherry-picking. In the end I was called a sea lion and removed from the mod team suddenly and unexpectedly.\n\nTL;DR r/curlyhair argued about wavy vs curly hair again so the mods made it a rule you have to be a certain race to use certain terms",

Then just two days ago the remaining [T_D mods rejected the approved new mod list provided by the admins and opened up their own mod applications]( https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/fgmbwu/after_reddit_admins_attempt_to_install_new/), responses to which are due by midnight Saturday.\n___\n\n**The_Fitton**\n\nWhile this nonsense has been going on between the moderators and the admins, the actual users on the sub have been growing increasingly upset.  15 days ago the moderators set the sub so that only approved submitters can make new posts.  \n\nSince the change the only posts on the sub have been a few moderator posts linking to Trump Tweets or making announcements, and photos of conservative activist group Judicial Watch\u2019s President [Tom Fitton]( https://i.redd.it/3nsixhnefoj41.jpg) [flexing](https://i.redd.it/19d0p2h14al41.jpg) [his]( https://i.redd.it/y67jn6r98wk41.jpg) [sick]( https://i.redd.it/v73sqfez8hk41.jpg) [biceps]( https://i.redd.it/8orl2kuobrj41.jpg) (username TFittonJW) along with editorialized titles of \u201cBreaking News.\u201d \nWhile some users are happy with their new subreddit takeover by Tom Fitton, dubbing the sub /r/The_Fitton, many are not so pleased that the moderators seem to be actively killing the subreddit in order to get more of their users to go to their offsite forum thedonald.win.\n___\n\n**Cabin Fever**\n\nHere are some samples of the increasingly upset T_D users mad at their mods for censoring their free speeeeeeech.\n\n\u2026\n\n>Wow a T_D thread that hasn't been locked by gay mods yet.\n\n>>Moron moderators\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/fexlic/fitton_biggest_big_tech_censorship_reddit/fjvfu3j/\n\n\u2026.\n\n>We know.\n\n>They did it, they effectively killed t_d.\n\n\n>I mean look at it... you posted this 19 minutes ago and it only has 17 comments.\n\n>>And the fucking mods locking everything to try and force us to .win.\n\n>>>This pisses me off more than Spez and the cucks. The moron moderators who think everyone is going to go to win are really fucking this thing up.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/fexlic/fitton_biggest_big_tech_censorship_reddit/fjsu4tc/\n\u2026\n\n>i had a three day suspension on T_D for speaking out against the mods and talking about what really happened with old/new mods. Um, that's fascism.\n\n\n>There is NO WAY I'm putting my traffic on Win.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/fdz5tn/fitton_big_call_out_on_reddit_suppression_of_the/fjtypzw/\n\n\u2026\n\n>The news mods will not allow genuine conversations or voicing of concerns of the issues raised in a news article.

We aren't coming out of quarantine, and we are held to a standard no other sub is.\n\n\n>That's the deal. Let's fucking go out on our proverbial shields. I don't want to play nice with biased, fascist admins anymore.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/fdz5tn/fitton_big_call_out_on_reddit_suppression_of_the/fjl2ytj/\n\n\u2026\n\n> Hey mods can you at least explain why the .win site has been down for 6 hours? You're acting like the purple-haired bitch from star wars and intentionally leaving us in the dark with no information and nothing to go on while we're being hunted. And I'm made out to be the asshole for asking wtf is going on.\n\n>>THIS\n\n>> Yeah. Kinda tired of being told to go to .win when I've tried several times and its slow af or down. I get there's growing pains, but damn. Stop shaming me for wanting to stay on here. Approve some new posters. Make more of us mods. I'm open for an interview anytime.\n\n>>> Aw, do you guys need somebody to hold your hands? We\u2019re all in this same boat, and things will smooth out. Bitching about it solves nothing.\n\n>>>> Neither does bitching at people to run off to a secluded corner of the internet...

Any one of us could post serious content or humorous stuff just mocking the leftists. It was still fun even after they quarantined us.

Who is he? Why is it the only post (basically daily) on the sub? Why is he so buff? Also, why is every thread locked after 2 seconds?\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/fdz5tn/fitton_big_call_out_on_reddit_suppression_of_the/fjks4yf/\n\u2026\n\n>Why do we always just see photos of this beefcake, instead of an actual article?

I hope this a temporary restriction. You can follow Judicial Watch and me on other social media in the meantime.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/fexlic/fitton_biggest_big_tech_censorship_reddit/fk7fboh/\n\nSince that comment, no additional posts have been made to T_D .\n\nAt this point, it seems that T_D is effectively dead.\n\nhttps://i.imgflip.com/3shjfj.jpg",

If you sort /r/all by rising, you can see the creation of fph subs in action! Fascinating! There are so many fatpeoplehate subs now, I can't even list them all, including fatpeoplehate314 and obesityrules (a sub akin to candidfashionpolice where they mockingly pretend to love obesity). \n\n\nEdit: Looks like some posts are starting to get removed from /r/pics (including the obese heart that reached /r/all), but some are still there. Not sure if the moderaters are just being slow or if they're choosing to leave some. \n\nEdit 2: [**OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT FROM /R/PICS**](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/39e82d/official_rpics_announcement_regarding_the_recent/) THE OBESITY PICTURES HAVE STOPPED.\n\nEdit 3: Unrelated to /r/pics, but I have found out that FPH has made their own website.

Will it stay? Will it go?!! We will not know! At least until probably tomorrow to see what the admins do. It'll probably get even worse if they ban a subreddit that has no actual hatred in it. \n\nFor tomorrow's forecast, I predict heavy drama with the possibility of continued FPH flooding.\n\n^^P.S. ^^Thanks ^^to ^^whoever ^^gilded ^^me! ^^I've ^^actually ^^only ^^read ^^like ^^50 ^^comments ^^of ^^my ^^own ^^thread ^^but ^^now ^^I ^^can ^^have ^^new ^^comments ^^highlighted ^^thanks ^^to ^^gold!\n\n**Probably Final Edit**: Added in some more news sites, but really there are too many articles to list now.

        "Title": "The old client was a mess but the \"new\" client feels like it never left the alpha phase",
        "Body/Content": "I have worked on and with many tools in my life and without a doubt I have **NEVER** seen a piece of software being this bugged or showcasing so many different bugs over one day alone. every patch its like they added a new bunch of weird bugs for you to discover. it's like they patch new bugs into the client by hand every week.\n\n**be it...**\n\n- the client swallowing up a huge chunk of performance the moment you switch to the loading screen\n\n- your loot window or store just staying black so you have to click somewhere else and try again\n\n- the post game screen taking forever to load. so you think you used the \"close client when ingame\" but you didn't and it takes longer to show up as if you actually restarted the client\n\n- the afk button working exactly the opposite of what you'd expect. so when you're normally afk the green dot turns red and people see you as afk while it goes back to green once you click on the client again. but when you mark you as afk by hand and after a few minutes the client recognizes you going afk for real, the red light actually turns to green. then everyone and their mother invites you and texts you and when you actually open the client knowing you've been marked as afk to check some messages, you can literally see the in the first half second how the green light turns red... basically the opposite of what normally would happen. then you get shit on by people who just wrote you because you because they think, that after their message you quickly tried to hide yourself as afk.\n\n- the countdown timer for bans and picks sometimes doesn't know how time works and puts you in a stress test by rushing down the last seconds like 8...7...654\u00b32..1...0\n\n- the lock/ban button being grayed out and taking a few seconds to register because it's 2003 and our internet is so slow we always need to wait for a response\n\n- champ selects never ending. sometimes you're just stuck with the people in champ select. time to meet some new friends tho\n\n- checking someones profile and when you click on his history it shows you your own\n\n- that every now and then the client feels like you're a slow learner so it shows you certain tutorials again when you click a certain window\n\n- some notifications (club invites, received or gifted gifts for example) never disappearing or popping up again over and over even when you dismissed and deleted them\n\n- the replay system sometimes saving \"highlights\" only with a loud ass drilling or vacuum noise instead of actual sound\n\n- changing your options every now and then. so before you start a game it swaps it to window mode for some reason (happens especially often this patch... like 6 games in a row)\n\n- resetting your config to make locked cam a standard option\n\n- not being able to delete a keybind when you assign it to a different function and double binds it. so every time you hit M for example it pings that there is a ward AND opens the ingame voice option. or every time you ping danger it also locks your cam.\n\n- week old chats popping up again marked as \"new message\" every now and then with nothing new in it\n\n- the accept button not doing anything once a game has been found putting all your premades blame onto you must have been afk\n\n- the client making a mistake and queuing me up with bad players from my proximity only because they somehow all know intimate details about my mother\n\n- the queue pop op never happening. only at the last second you see and hear a half second blink of the accept button including and error message and then you start over again\n\n- the client flckering after a game when you try to play again. clearing your friend list for a second then popping a bugsplat. but it won't close the client. instead it reopens completely empty in either green or gray. then it closes and opens again while showing a different part of the client missing everytime until it finally comes up again and you're like \"yeah, I'm not trusting that\" and you relog by hand\n\n- the lock button acting as a drum. sometimes it does nothing but you still can press it over and over enjoying that echoing blast while creating your own michael bay soundtrack\n\n- your friendlist groups changing positions for no reason\n\n- people not receiving invites until they restart the client\n\n- the client so many times not reacting\n\n- client not popping up after a game and being stuck in the \"game is still running\" window, after you pulled it out of the background by hand\n\n- client crashing ingame forcing you to relog, but you can't because it's stuck multiple times in the task manager so you have to shutdown it by force. then you relog and you get \"game is still running\" (no shit sherlock) but with no option to rejoin the game (not that it matters since it will give you a \"leave\" after the game anyway). you try like ten times until you realize you actually have to wait till the game is over\n\n- payments not updating so you're forced to restart the client and hope the client will finally recognize that you actually just paid to fund this beta test a bit more\n\n- some games randomly missing the grade or rating (like B, A- or S+) for no reason in the history\n\n- invites not happening. you type in the name, mark it and invite it. but it never shows up as invited\n\n- the client asking for a firewall permission... EVERY patch. so you create one. but it never deletes the old ones. so you'll notice a huge mountain of firewall rules just for this one game when you ever check your firewall settings\n\n- the client stacking up logfiles forever growing and growing with every patch, fix, release, newsfeed. it feels like you're using some third party tool created by some student new to IT which you have to delete every few months and do a fresh installation otherwise your league folder will grow bigger and bigger just thanks to log files and data waste\n\n**I'll add other peoples bugs to the list (I can't confirm those since some of those never happened to me. I'm just adding them):**\n\n- u/D3ad_ShoT has no \u201cyour store\u201d tab and or a \u201cstats\u201d tab in his profile\n\n- an incorrect listing when you sort champs by recently played (u/WhildishFlamingo)\n\n- If someones summoner name is too long the client clips the whole chat UI and you can't see messages properly. (u/Supahh)\n\n- not being able to load the own ranked screen for months no (u/0j0n)\n\n- can't select a default (u/3kindsofsalt)\n\n- downloading small patches which are only like 7-15MB big... always takes 10-15 minutes as if you're using dial-up. oh and estimated time is always approx 2 days\n\n- receiving a gift doesn't pop sometimes (just a red dot on the bell). so people take forever to notice that they got a gift (u/beepbeepwow)\n\n- cant access the shop recently. Even if the client gets restarted every time it pops an unexpected error 999 (u/Xilo_Atomik)\n\n- selecting a champion and locking in and then being kicked, losing LP for queue dodging (u/falc0nsmash)\n\n- Sometimes client will say there was an error retrieving information about a match and doesn't let you download it to replay. (u/fsartori)\n\n- You've been disconnected from chat. Trying again... (u/fsartori)\n\n- Client disconnects you from voice chat. You click on Connect. It plays the sound like you're connecting, wait a few seconds, you're dcd again. (u/fsartori)\n\n- (Not sure if they fixed this one already) Players in friends list looking like they've been playing a game for over an hour when in reality they finished a long time ago and they're either afk, dcd, online, or playing a new game. And btw you can't invite them to your lobby. (u/fsartori) [I actually remember this from the old client too where people were in games for no less then 5000+ minutes]\n\n- History in chats goes crazy. Either deletes your history too quickly, or deletes only parts of it so the latest conversation makes no sense at all. (u/fsartori)\n\n- the issue where if you close the client and reopen. sometimes it will say \"we have reverted your client to a previous version\" and has to repatch the most recent patch? Usually happens when the client won't load so you have to terminate it under processes. (u/o__________________e)\n\n- if you alt-tab out during the loading screen and you haven't hit 100%, there's a huge chance that there won't be healthbar in the game (u/depwnz) [seems more ingame related]\n\n- If you disconnect during a game and it ends during that period. It keeps saying game is going on and only reconnect is available. When you do reconnect you're stuck with you can't connect to server please check your connection. You have to close and open the client to play more (u/ZainTheOne)\n\n- takes forever to pick runes in champ select or register them as active (u/yungrokvaa)\n\n- random rune page and emote config resets. either several emotes disappear from your inventory or they get unequipped ingame. also the rune page resets or it randomly just deletes the 2nd rune tree between two games of playing the same champ in the same role (u/reijin u/Chijima)\n\n- the inability to click on the party after clicking away because the button is grayed out and it says \"you have to restart your client\" (u/that_one_soraka)\n\n- Friend list doesn\u2019t appear on champion selection screen (u/Flymetothemoon1335) [more like a missing feature]\n\n- certain non-esports news seem to be hidden sometimes (u/fenwickfox)\n\n- getting black squares that cover the client sometimes which blocks out most of the screen when trying to pick a champion or when trying to change runes (u/GameplayerStu)\n\n- you get items that don't seem to exist. You get the unlocked pop-up, with the icon, with the name. When you check your inventory there's no yellow thingy showing you where your new loot is. The emote shown in the pop-up cannot be found in the list of available emotes. Owned or not owned. same with ward skins (u/oneeyedhank)\n\n- having my summoner spells changed every champion select to exhaust and cleanse (u/Pawos)\n\n- The role selection circle appearing in random places and making unable to choose roles cus they are off-screen. (u/swegmen1)\n\n- Net disconnects for 5 seconds? Sorry we can't reconnect you, you have to exit the client and restart it, no other way to reconnect. (u/swegmen1)\n\n- Saving runes with 10 seconds on the clock results in runes not being saved. (u/swegmen1)\n\n- Btw, let me organize my emotes quickly before game, oh nvm it shows I don't have any equipped. (u/swegmen1)\n\n- Visiting the store huh? Unexpected error sry, also the \"ok\" button doesn't work and the \"x\" close button on the top right is greyed out so u gotta end the task in the process list to quit the client. (u/swegmen1)\n\n- Did u just log in? Oh wait we gotta load every friend on ur list one by one, in the meanwhile if you click on anything nothing will happen, after friendslist are loaded everything u clicked on before will register and you will visit 50 pages same time. (u/swegmen1)\n\n- You trying to reconnect to your game? Sorry, according to us you are already ingame and theres no game to reconnect to, try restarting the client and pray you didnt miss half the game cause of a bugsplat. (u/swegmen1)\n\n- I check the \"never show this tip again\" on the autofill msg, next day I get that msg again. (u/swegmen1)\n\n- Did you hover over something just before a game was found? The tooltip is going to be stuck hovering over ur champion select, gives u some extra time to read it properly. (u/swegmen1)\n    \n- Are you in a lobby but visited ur profile/store while waiting? Sorry the lobby button is greyed out, no way to go back to the lobby. (u/swegmen1)\n\n- I see you are trying to buy a skin with IRL hard earned money, let me give you a heart attack by giving u an error msg after purchasing the skin without actually any error happening... syke bitch. (u/swegmen1)\n\n- I like the choice u made with your new icon, lets revert that change real quick for no reason. (u/swegmen1)\n\n- you get low priority queue and have to wait for 20min before every game. But then 20 mins pass and you still dont get a queue even though its ARAM, so you let it run and it just continues to count the timer now at -5mins before a queue pops, so then you restart the queue wait for another 20 mins and then it actually counts and lets you find a game but that solution only works 20% of the time and you have 5 games before you escape that bug loop hellhole (u/FirenBelmont)\n\n- highlights are muted for no reason (u/TheDarkRobotix)\n\n- when using Discord, getting a blue-screen issue with the Client. (u/Ungoliath)\n\n- still can\u2019t minimise league on Mac (u/Yoyozz97) [I don't have a mac but the mac client seems to be the last circle of hell in general]\n\n- the friends list doesn't update till you exit the game and some time passes (this ranges between a few seconds to 1-2 minutes) when set to Low Performance mode. (u/rogama)\n\n- Another issue is when you get a leaverbuster, you can't even type to your friends who are messaging you (u/scrappyHDD) [not sure if this isn't actually something riot wants since they changed it a while ago so that premades of a leaver buster'd player can at least use the client normally... but if so... not sure what it accomplishes]\n\n- champions not loading in champ select so you have to sit out the timer till you dodge automatically (u/Hallgrimsson)\n\n- if someone declines the queue right at the beginning everyone has to wait for the time to fully count down. (u/eertelppa) [also if I hit accept... **WHY** do I have to still listen to that loud and long wind sound till the timer is done and everyone accepted?]\n\n- having at least 3 \"bugsplat\" prompts every time trying to patch the game (u/Quave11)\n\n- client crashing and causing a bugsplat mid champ select. but instead of dodging it stays in champ select forcing you to play with whatever runes and summs you had picked before (u/Mienee)\n\n- every single piece of setting changed back to standard at some point during this patch... for some multiple times (u/GlideStrife)\n\n- getting an error: \u201cyou can\u2019t log on because you may be offline\u201d even tho you're clearly online. you have go in and delete the client log every time. And on top of that, it forces you to delete the new patch and reinstall it. (u/Tnew009)\n\n- Client volume dragged all the way up after every patch. (u/175913122017) [also they re-activated the ingame music for me this patch multiple time...]\n\n- weird bug where whenever you want to open level 4 capsules the client crash (u/i-want-to-die-mabye)\n\n- rare bug in champ select where it displays that one champ is hovered/marked and when you lock in it locks me into another champion (u/NALittleFox)\n\n- you have an add friend button inside lobby on the banner if you're not already friend of someone. but it has never worked for me, you can also spam it indefinitely. but after all you need to manually add him from the friendslist (u/Tukesuper)\n\n- sometimes, when you close the client, the app is still in the Task Manager so, if you open the game again, nothing happens. You have to manually kill the process first. (u/elveszett)\n\n- chat doesnt even work in a blind pick lobby? U can see the text bar, but u can't click it. (u/GamingFist)\n\n- [THIS](http://puu.sh/CfVdu/9da9f7f54e.jpg) it gets bigger after every game if you don't restart the client (u/Haus15)\n\n- not being able to minimize the client (u/Ericfyre)\n\n- the client sometimes transports you to a different dimension while in queue and you end up in some random lobby with a random champ locked counting down before game starts (u/FlurryRushNA)\n\n- randomly in ARAM you get kicked from \"champ select\" and the client says its because you don't picked a champion... and the time is always far from 0 (u/Jhulyus)\n\n- Changing resolution in game can lead to client going super small mode, only focuses on like 50x200 pixles in the middle of the client, making it impossible change anything or to turn it off without task manager. (u/Yomasevz)\n\n- After a game is finished and your client should pop up with \"waiting for stats\", it doesn't and reduces itself to a small black rectangle. Voice chat still works, but the only way to get rid of this visual bug is to restart the client. It shrinks in the process (after you start it up when restarting, it will change its visual settings to a smaller window, less pixels) (u/LeBleach)\n\n- Sometimes missions don't register when you complete them and then you have to wait for 1 day to receive the reward. (u/Ericfigif)\n\n- sometimes when you have to update the client it finishes and then freezes. so you close it and have to repatch (because it goes back to a previous version) and this repeats about 4 - 5 times before the client finally updates and is normal again. Sometimes it still doesn't even open though (u/CrybabyAlois)\n\n- More often than not: whenever you honor someone they don't get the specific type of honor you clicked. instead it gives the one next to it (u/Davtaz)\n\n- when you're playing with premades, you get bugsplat, you reconnect, you are able to connect to game but you're kicked out of lobby so you can't voice chat with your friends. (u/fsartori)\n\n- some people miss out on quite a few we games because they do not have the client open in the background. since it has such a high CPU usage. so they end up playing less and less league because they don't see invites from friends (u/HeyItsChase)\n\n**...for example**\n\nand the worst part about all this? this only scratches the surface\n\nand the **ACTUAL** worst part about all this? this doesn't even mention the bugs you encounter ingame.\n\nthis whole thing feels like it's been worked on or at least supervised by people who lack knowledge, foresight and skill. like they add more and more stuff but it feels like they never optimized it to begin with so the client isn't even optimized to handle all these features. basically like the bethesdas creation engine. the whole thing isn't capable of doing all this stuff but they're adding it anyway making it a mess to work with.\n\nI get the feeling that in the early days the devs at riot weren't that capable. now they got the money and may have hired people who actually know their shit. but the old crew has been working there for so long now that they are in charge or at least got the last word in many decisions. I see this so often with customers. old ass skill and knowledge lacking people are leading a department over younger and more trained people who actually know what they are doing. not because they earned it but because they simply got the time in the company on their side (the only part not affected by this... the art department). these people are the biggest reason so many companies are stuck with old tech and old ideas. because they are stubborn and their ego can't handle the fact that some new kid might be in the right and actually might have the better ideas. so they block most of it. because \"it worked for me all those years\" or \"this is how I've done it all the time... its ok\". they just can't adapt to new technology. that's one the reasons major companies and government offices use old ass tech like win95 or DOS or tools requiring those OS up to this day (being it the army, traffic authority or wolde wide operating big ass biomedical technology companies). and I'm not talking about some third world country here. It's always the same scenario and the same picture when you come into a new company to provide a solution for problem. there are always people blocking everything off or there are still people employed who you recognize as the typical \"no idea what they are talking about\" type when you ask them a few questions. and you wonder \"why is this dude working here?\". and everything that seems wrong with the game or the client always reminds me of those problems.\n\nriot once stated that the code is so fucked up that they can't even touch certain things without knowing what might happen. like they change the cooldown of one champ's E spell or the AA range of another and for some reason it fucks up how smite works... for only 7 random other champs. since riot once stated that there will never be a league of legends 2 I feel like we're always stuck with the same problems just looking different with every major update.\n\nPS: sorry for lacking english skills\n\n**EDIT:** added other peoples bugs to the list",

        "Title": "Why we won't have a long term bear market, and how to systematically pick your future investments in crypto",
        "Body/Content": "With so much uncertainty right now it would be a good time to take some time to go over what happened recently and how to invest moving foward. We've seen a peak bubble at around 850 billion total market cap in the first week of January, consolidated down to $750 billion and have now just experienced a 40% correction. \n\n#What's happening now and how bad will it get?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst of all you should realize that there is a [January Dip that happens every year, when we see a roughly 20-30% decline around mid January](https://i.imgur.com/VXEHw0W.png). This year its been much more severe though for several additional factors that have compounded on top.\n\nDifferent theories exist on why this happens (its actually the mirror opposite of the \"January Effect\" that happens in the US stock market), but the two major theories are:\n\n1) Asian markets pull into fiat because of Asian New Year spending needs\n\n2) People in the US sell in January to defer their capital gains tax liability an extra year\n\nWhile this cyclic event has lead to a healthy correction in the last few years, this year we got these new factors making more fear as well:\n\n* [Yet more scary news on China cracking down on crypto exchanges](http://www.coindesk.com/pboc-official-calls-for-wider-ban-on-chinese-crypto-trading-report/)\n\n* [Korea regulatory uncertainty](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-16/cryptocurrencies-resume-slide-as-bitcoin-tumbles-to-december-low)\n\n* [European governments talking about regulations](http://news.yahoo.com/rule-bitcoin-must-global-germanys-central-bank-says-154144224--business.html)\n\n* [BTC futures contracts are now expiring this week](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_settlements_futures.html), and possible manipulation there with contract hedging pushing the price down\n\n* Bitconnect Ponzi finally collapses\n\n* We had a new breed of speculators come in during the November/December timeframe after media made cryptocurrency mainstream following the Bitcoin 10K landmark. While cryptocurrency markets have always had too much hype, the latest rise wasn't just over-enthusiasm in fundamentally sound cryptocurrencies like Monero and Ethereum, but mass inflows of fiat into vaporware and complete nonsense without any use case. Many people came in to essentially gamble on symbols on an exchange, and are thus short term oriented and quick to sell on any slight downturn, which such further adds to selling pressure.\n\nSo in essence we got a storm of scary news along with the usual cyclic downturn. Currently I don't see this as being a systematic crash like Mt.Gox was that would lead to a long term bear market because the fundamental ecosystem is still intact, and I suspect that after about a month we should consolidate around a new low. All the exchanges are still operational and liquid, and there is no breakdown in trust nor uncertainty whether you'll be able to cash out. What range the market trades in will all depend how Bitcoin does, right now we've already broken below 10K but I'm seeing a lot of support at around $8000, which is [roughly where the long term MA curve settles](https://i.imgur.com/kKVsoUt.png). We don't know how bad it will get or what the future will bring, but as of right now we shouldn't be in a bear market yet.\n\n**What should you do if you recently entered the market?**\n\nIf you did buy in the last few months at or near ATH, the very worst thing you can do now is sell in panic and lose your principal. You shouldn't have more money in crypto than you can afford to lose, so it shouldn't be a problem to wait. You have to realize that 30% corrections in crypto are relatively common, just last fall we had a 40% flash correction over more China fears. Unless there is a systematic breakdown like we had during Mt.Gox, the market always recovers. \n\nThe other worst thing you can do is unload into Tether as your safety net. If there is one thing that could actually cause a long term destruction of trust within the cryptocurrency investment ecosystem, its Tether having a run up on their liabilities and not having enough reserve to cover the leverage. It would not only bring down exchanges but lead to years of litigation and endless media headlines that will scare off everybody from putting fiat in. I don't know when the next Mt.Gox meltdown will occur but I can almost guarantee it will involve Tether. So stay away from it.\n\n**What should long term investors do?**\n\nFor long term holders a good strategy to follow each year is to capture profit each December and swallow the capital gains taxation liability, park a reserve of fiat at Gemini (whose US dollar deposits are FDIC-insured) and simply wait till around late January to early February to re-enter the market at a discount and hold all year until next December. You can keep a small amount in core coins in order to trade around various Q1 opportunities you anticipate. Others may choose to simply do nothing and just keep holding throughout January which is also a perfectly fine strategy. The cyclical correction usually stabilizes toward late January and early February, then we see a rise in March and generally are recovered by end of April. Obviously this decision whether to sell in December to profit on the dip and pay tax liability or to just hold will depend on your individual tax situation. Do your own math sometime in November and follow suit. \n\nEssentially revaluate your positions and trim your position sizes if you don't feel comfortable with the losses.\n\n#How to construct your portfolio going forward\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRather than seeing the correction as a disaster see it as a time to start fresh. If you have been FOMO-ing into bad cryptos and losing money now is a time to start a systematic long term approach to investing rather than gambling.\n \n\n**Follow a methodology for evaluating each cryptocurrency**\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMemes and lambo dreams are fun and all, but I know many of you are investing thousands of dollars into crypto, so its worth it to put some organized thought into it as well. I can't stress enough how important it is to try and logically contruct your investment decisions. If you follow a set methodology, a checklist and template you will be able to do relative comparisons between cryptocurrencies, to force yourself to consider the negatives and alternative scenarios and also sleep comfortably knowing you have a sound basis for your investment decisions (even if they turn out to be wrong). \n\nThere is no ideal or \"correct\" methodology but I can outline mine:\n\n**1) Initial information gathering and filtering**\n\nOnce I identify something that looks like a good potential investment, I first go to the CoinMarketCap page for that symbol and look at the website and blockchain explorer. \n\n* Critically evaluate the website. This is the first pass of the bullshit detector and you can tell from a lot from just the website whether its a scam. If it uses terms like \"Web 4.0\" or other nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and has anonymous teams, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past. \n\n* Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. Look for red flags like massive portions of the float being assigned to the founders of the coin, vague definition of who would use the coin, anonymous teams, promises of large payouts...etc\n\n* Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts holding or selling? Which account is likely the foundation account, which is the founders account? \n\n* Read the subreddit and blogs for the cryptocurrency and also evaluate the community. Try to figure out exactly what the potential use cases are and look for sceptical takes. Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?\n\n\n**2) Fill out an Investment Checklist**\n\nI have a checklist of questions that I find important and as I'm researching a crypto I save little snippets in Evernote of things that are relevant to answering those questions:\n\n* What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve?\n\n* What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized?\n\n* Who is their competition and how big is the market they're targeting? What is the roadmap they created?\n\n* What current product exists?\n\n* How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional?\n\n* What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?\n\n\n\n**3) Create some sort of consistent valuation model/framework, even if its simple** \n\nI have a background in finance so I like to do Excel modeling. For those who are interested in that, this [article is a great start](https://hackernoon.com/the-7-things-you-need-to-know-from-the-valuing-cryptocurrency-conference-call-c238095a03b9) and also Chris Burniske has a great blog about using Quantity Theory of Money to build an equivalent of a DCF analysis for crypto.\n\n[Here is an Excel file example of OMG done using his model](http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvYGe0TA-rZR00iAV2PDI-B9zba6GpEG1FodECWJDys/edit).  You can download this and play around with it yourself, see how the formulas link and understand the logic.\n\nOnce you have a model set up the way you like in Excel you can simply alter it to account for various float oustanding schedule and market items that are unique to your crypto, and then just start plugging in different assumptions. Think about what is the true derivation of value for the coin, is it a \"dividend\" coin that you stake within a digital economy and collect fees or is it a currency? Use a realistic monetary velocity (around 5-10 for currency and around 1-2 for staking) and for the discount rate use at least 3x the long term return of a diversified equity fund.\n\nThe benefit is that this forces you to think about what actually makes this coin valuable to an actual user within the digital economy its participating in and force you to think about the assumptions you are making about the future.  Do your assumptions make sense? What would the assumptions have to be to justify its current price? You can create different scenarios in a matrix (optimistic vs. pessimistic) based on different assumptions for risk (discount rate) and implementation (adoption rates).\n\nIf you don't understand the above thats perfectly fine, you don't need to get into full modeling or have a financial background. Even a simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do\n\n* [Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic. \n\n* Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply. For example the total supply for Dentacoin is 1,841,395,638,392, and when multiplied by its price in early January we get a market cap that is actually higher than the entire industry it aims to disrupt: Dentistry. \n\n* If its meant to be just used as just a currency: Take a look at the circulating supply and look at the amount that is in cold storage or set to be released/burned. Most cryptos are deflationary so think about how the float schedule will change over time and how this will affect price. \n\nOnce you have a model you like set up, you can compare cryptos against each other and most importantly it will require that you build a mental framework within your own mind on why somebody would want to own this coin other than to sell it to another greater fool for a higher price. Modeling out a valuation will lead  you to think long term and think about the inherent value, rather than price action.\n\nOnce you go through this 3-step methodology, you'll have a pretty good confidence level for making your decision and can comfortably sit back and not panic if some temporary short term condition leads to a price decrease. This is how \"smart money\" does it.\n\n**Think about your portfolio allocation**\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou should think first in broad terms how you allocate between \"safe\" and \"speculative\" cryptos. \n\nFor new investors its best to keep a substantial portion in what would be considered largecap safe cryptos, primarily BTC, ETH, LTC. I personally consider XMR to be safe as well. A good starting point is to have between 50-70% of your portfolio in these safe cryptocurrencies. As you become more confident and informed you can move your allocation into speculative small caps.\n\nYou should also think in terms of segments and how much of your total portfolio is in each segment:\n\n* Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum, LTC...etc\n\n* Platform segment - Ethereum, NEO, Ark...etc\n\n* Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash, PivX..etc\n\n* Finance/Bank settlement segment - Ripple, Stellar...etc\n\n* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment -VeChain, Walton, WABI...etc\n\n* Promising/Innovative Tech segment - Raiblocks, IOTA, Cardano...etc\n\nYou should also think about where we are in the cycle, as now given so much uncertaintly its probably best to stay heavily in core holdings and pick up a few coins within a segment you understand well. If you don't understand how enterprise solutions work or how the value chain is built through corporations, don't invest in the enteprise blockchain solutions segment. If you are a technie who loves the technology behind Cardano or IOTA, invest in that segment.\n\n**Think of your \"circle of competence\"**\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is actually a term Buffet came up with, it refers to your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Think about what you know best and consider investing in those type of coins. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain or WaltonChain will achieve adoption? \n\nThis where your portfolio allocation also comes into play. You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every segment and for every type of crypto you come across. If you had over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well. \n\n\n**Continually educate yourself about the technology and markets**\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you aren't already doing it: Read a bit each day about cryptocurrencies. There are decent Youtubers that talk about the market side of crypto, just avoid those that hype specific coins and look for more sceptical ones like CryptoInvestor. If you don't understand how the technology works and what the benefits of a blockchain are or how POS/POW works or what a DAG is or how mining actually works, learn first. If you don't care about the technology or find reading about it tedious, you shouldn't invest in this space at all.\n\n\n#Summing it up\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI predicted a few days ago that we would have a major correction in 2018 specifically in the altcoins that saw massive gains in Decemeber/early January, and it seems we've already had a pretty big one. I don't think we'll have a complete meltdown like some are predicting, but some more pain may be incoming.\n\nBasically take this time to think about how you can improve your investment style and strategy. Make a commitment to value things rather than chasing FOMO, and take your time to make a decision. Long term investment will grant you much more returns as will a systematic approach.\n\nTake care and have fun investing :)\n\n**Edit March 2018**: Lol looking back I'm regretting starting the title with \"Why we won't have a long term bear market\" now, I was more karma whoring with that catchy title than anything. We recovered up to 11K from this post, but then crashed again hard later in February-March because of a slew of reasons from Tether subpeona to unforseen regulatory issues.",

        "Title": "Two Malicious Compliances Equals One Pro Revenge",
        "Body/Content": "This is being posted under my alt, as some of my people know my main reddit username. And I never was in it for the Karma.  \n\nSeveral years ago, Barry, my boss, did a job for BigDaddy Construction, and got screwed. It wasn\u2019t a huge amount of money, a couple of thousand dollars, but screwed is screwed. Basically, he accepted BigDaddy\u2019s word on something that they denied later. Barry consulted his lawyer, and was told that since the issue was not in writing, that any legal action was likely to fail, and even if he won, that the legal costs would exceed any settlement. And BigDaddy basically said, \u201cMy lawyer can beat up your lawyer.\u201d  \n\nBarry then asked what every lawyer likes to hear, \u201cWhat should I have done differently?\u201d  \n\nFast forward to 2017. BigDaddy is soliciting bids for a new restaurant called FancyAss. Barry submits a bid for supplying and installing door hardware, things like doorknobs, emergency exit bars, door closers that pull the doors shut\u2026and 3 Automatic Door Operators (ADO\u2019s). An ADO is something you have seen before, it has a metal plate with a wheelchair logo mounted on the wall, when you press it, a motor opens the door. It\u2019s designed to allow people with limited mobility to pass through a doorway.  \n\nBarry wins the bid, and calls a meeting. He is handling this job personally. All communication with BigDaddy is to go through Barry, and ONLY Barry. If someone from BigDaddy calls and says, \u201cNice weather, isn\u2019t it?\u201d we are to reply, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know anything about that, let me transfer you to Barry\u2019s line.\u201d Under no circumstances is anyone from BigDaddy to be given Barry\u2019s cell number. And the after-hours on-call techs are only to return the call and say that Barry will be in touch in the morning. Violation of any of this will be grounds for immediate dismissal for cause, is this perfectly clear?  \n\nA few weeks go by, and we get a call from \u201cGC\u201d, who not only is running the job for BigDaddy, but is BigDaddy\u2019s son. He\u2019s an entitled shitball of a tyrant, with anger issues and a vocabulary that relies heavily on profanity. I\u2019m calling him \u201cGC\u201d because that\u2019s his job title, General Contractor.  \n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, a GC is responsible for ensuring that everything gets done on a construction site in the correct order. For example, if you are building a bathroom, first you put up the wall studs, then the electrical is run and the plumbing supply lines are roughed in. next the drywall goes up, then the tile, and the baseboards. The walls, ceiling, and trim get painted, then the cabinets, light fixtures and switches are installed. Lastly the plumbing fixtures go in. So you can see, a GC has to deal with several different subcontractors and co-ordinate their efforts. It\u2019s a stressful job, and you need the co-operation of the various people\u2026.and it\u2019s hard to get people to work with you if you\u2019re screaming swear words at them, something GC never figured out.  \n\nThis might be a good time to give you a [visual of the restaurant layout](https://imgur.com/a/7TRVPQ9). This is by no means to scale, just a sketch to give you an idea of what\u2019s going on.  \n\nThere are 3 ADO\u2019s to be installed, 2 on the entrance and one on the handicapped washroom. The conventional washrooms are down a set of stairs on the right, and by law, there has to be a washroom available for people using wheelchairs, marked as HC on the drawing. This is on a bit of a corridor of sorts used by the servers to bring food in and dishes out. The partitions separating the corridor are about shoulder-high, separating the corridor from the seating area, which is what the circles with 4 chairs represent. These are tables, booths, etc., with a smattering of service stands for order entry, and bits and pieces like extra cutlery.  \n\nThe d\u00e9cor was fancy, and meant to resemble a Victorian Gentlemen\u2019s Club, with oak throughout, and thick carpets on the floors. Worthy of mention is the feature wall at the front, with alcoves for displaying sculptures, and places to hang paintings.  \n\nSo GC calls us, and they are ready for the ADO\u2019s.  \n\nWe arrive, and install. By the terms of the bid, it\u2019s BigDaddy\u2019s responsibility to supply dedicated 120v electricity for the ADOs and to run the 12v wires from the activation plates to the top of the doorway so they can be connected to the circuit board for the ADO. This wasn\u2019t present at the time of the install, so he ran an extension cord to power the ADO, and used a wireless transmitter and receiver to trigger it. All of this was specified in the bid, which said that we could install, and then return to hook up the wires once they get run. Barry came and supervised the tech installing the ADOs personally. When GC signed off, buried in the description was a line or two referencing the relevant sections of the bid.  \n\nWhen GC signed off on the handicap washroom install there was a line noting that BigDaddy assumes all responsibility for compliance with the relevant building code section.  \n\nGC didn\u2019t bother to read what he was signing, just scribbled a signature and took his copy. Barry made certain the tech was right beside him when GC signed off.  \n\n- **Malicious Compliance #1**  \n\nIt\u2019s about 2 weeks before opening, and they are in the finishing stages. Barry gets a frantic call from GC that none of the ADO\u2019s are working, and they need these to be functional, or they won\u2019t get their occupancy permit. Barry heads down the next day with the tech.  \n\nBarry: \u201cWell, I found the problem.\u201d  \nGC: \u201cSo fix the fucking problem\u201d  \nBarry: \u201cThere\u2019s no 120v run to the doors, and there\u2019s no 12v wires to hook up the buttons.\u201d  \nGC: \u201cYou didn\u2019t run the power? Why didn\u2019t you run the power?\u201d  \nBarry: \u201cIt\u2019s not in the scope of work in the bid. You\u2019re supposed to do it.\u201d  \nGC: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that when you were here the first time.\u201d  \nBarry: \u201cI did, and you signed off on it.\u201d  \nGC: \u201cWhere\u2019s the fucking electrician? Electrician, get your ass over here.\u201d  \nElectrician: \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d  \nGC: \u201cWhy isn\u2019t there any power for these door operators?\u201d  \nElectrician: \u201cIt\u2019s not part of my scope of work.\u201d  \nBarry: \u201cThere\u2019s some good news\u2026\u201d  \nGC: \u201cWhat?\u201d  \nBarry: \u201cIf we use wireless for the buttons, we won\u2019t need 12v wires. I\u2019ll have to bill you for it as an add-on, but once you get me 120v, these ADO\u2019s will be working.\u201d  \n\nNOW GC realizes how fucked he is. The interior of the restaurant is 90% complete, and there is no power to a critical part of the building. Without it, no permit. BigDaddy has fucked up big time, assuming that either Barry or the Electrician would run the wires, and not putting it into the scope of either bid. The electrical panel is in the back of the kitchen, and there\u2019s no way to bring 120v to the front entrance, except across the ceiling, which would be nearly impossible. All of the lighting and the ornate false ceiling was already in. Even if he was able to magically do that, he would either have to run a metal conduit down the surface of the feature wall, or rip out a good chunk of it, run the wires, and reinstall it.\nThe handicap washroom ADO wasn\u2019t as much of a problem, since it was closer and the wires could be run through the false ceiling. The section that contained the handicap washroom also had offices and storage with a t-bar ceiling, unlike the main room, that had 20 foot ceilings. The electrician charged GC big dollars for the extra work.  \n\n- **Malicious Compliance #2**  \n\nRemember the handicap washroom? When the building inspector came to do a pre-check, they discovered that the square footage of the washroom, minus the area taken up by the in-swinging door, was less than the required minimum. They needed a quick fix, as dismantling the washroom, moving a wall, and relocating the plumbing fixtures would be too expensive, and would take too long. So GC decided to reverse the swing of the door, and have it swing into the corridor, rather than into the washroom. This had a really bad effect on the operation of FancyAss once it opened, as any time someone wanted to use the washroom, the door blocked the flow of servers in and out of the kitchen. And people are lazy\u2026even able bodied people were prone to using this washroom as it was closest. I don\u2019t know what the conversations between FancyAss and BigDaddy were like, but I imagine they were pretty intense\u2026.but who gives a fuck. GC signed off on that, too.  \n\nAnd Barry got to invoice for a whole new ADO, as the original was a \u201cpull\u201d style, and reversing the swing meant that a \u201cpush\u201d style was required.  \n\n- **Pro Revenge**  \n\nGC called a few days after discovering that the entrance doors needed 120v, to tell Barry that the 120v was available. Barry heads down with the tech to check it out.  \n\nIn the vestibule was a heater known as an \u201cair curtain\u201d. It\u2019s a big heater, designed to push a high volume of warmed air into the vestibule, to mitigate cold outside air entering the restaurant. It pulls a significant amount of electricity every time it kicks on, and GC had tied the 120v for the entrance door ADO\u2019s into the same circuit.  \n\nBarry explains that the bid specified that the ADO\u2019s require their own dedicated circuits, one for each. GC responds that he doesn\u2019t give a shit, hook the goddamn things up, so Barry does, and has GC sign off again. Only this time buried in the sign off sheet is an acknowledgement that by not providing dedicated circuits, all warranties are void, and subsequent service would be billable. Just like usual, GC scribbles his signature and takes his copy without reading it.  \n\nThese ADO\u2019s are finicky about power. There\u2019s a motor (obviously) controlled by a circuit board that determines how fast the door opens, how long it stays open, how fast it closes, how much force is used, that sort of thing. If it takes a spike in power it fails, and the ADO no longer functions.  \n\nA power spike blows a fuse and damages one of the components of the control board. This is replaceable, and the part is worth about 30 bucks. The control board can be fixed in about half an hour, with another half hour on a scope to make certain everything is good. Barry had sent one of the techs to the manufacturer to be certified in rebuilding the board, even though our standard was to just ship them back to the manufacturer and get a replacement.  \n\nSure enough, a couple of days later GC calls in a panic. They have the final occupancy inspection scheduled for the next day, and one of the ADO\u2019s at the entrance is down.  \n\nGC: \u201cYour fucking ADO isn\u2019t working. Get down here and fix it.\u201d  \nBarry: \u201cOkay, but this isn\u2019t covered under warranty. It\u2019s billable.\u201d  \nGC: \u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about? It\u2019s not even been a week and it\u2019s broken. It\u2019s warranty.\u201d  \nBarry: \u201cNo, warranties were all voided when you didn\u2019t provide clean power.\u201d  \nGC: \u201cFuck that. Get down here and put in a new ADO.\u201d  \nBarry: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need a new ADO. It needs a new control board. And I can get a new control board from the manufacturer in 4 to 6 weeks.\u201d  \n\nGC loses his mind. There\u2019s no way he can delay the opening of FancyAss for 6 weeks waiting for a part. He calls Barry every name in the book, threatens legal action, etc.  \n\nBarry responds, \u201cLook GC, I have a control board on the shelf that was rebuilt by a factory certified technician. I can let you have it at 80% of the list price of a new one, and I can have it installed by noon tomorrow. Do you want the rebuilt, or the new part, and do you agree that this is billable as per the terms of the bid?\u201d  \n\nGC: \u201cYes! Just get the fucking thing fixed by tomorrow!\u201d  \n\nNow Barry knows that GC and BigDaddy were going to fuck him just like they did years ago. That ended up being a \u201cI never said that\u201d dispute. What GC didn\u2019t know was every time he called Barry, the call was recorded. You know the \u201cThis call may recorded for quality assurance purposes\u201d that you get when you dial in? Well Barry never used his cell phone, never initiated a call, and every time GC called in it was recorded and archived. Every. Single. Time.  \n\nSure enough, another couple of days go by, and an ADO goes down again. Barry asks if GC is good with the rebuild, gets confirmation, removes the blown part, installs the rebuild, then takes the blown control board back to the shop and rebuilds it.  \n\nA new control board is $750.00. The rebuild he\u2019s charging $600.00, for a part that maybe costs $75 to get back into shape. The bid specified that non-warranty service was $125/hr minimum 4 hours, so tack on another $500.00 for labour, and it takes maybe 45 minutes to install a new control board and dial it in. So every control board replacement was generating $1,100.00.  \n\nThere were 27 blown control board swaps in the first 2 months. GC called in every one of them, and Barry got his verbal approval. If someone from FancyAss called in, we gave them GC\u2019s number, and said that we could only come and fix it if GC was the one to call it in.  \n\nThen Barry gets a call from Daddy of BigDaddy wanting to know what this invoice for almost 30 grand is for. Barry explains, and a meeting is called, Barry brings his lawyer, and all copies of the sign-off sheets, as well as transcripts of every conversation he had with GC. It becomes very apparent that GC fucked up large, and that Barry had every \u201cI\u201d dotted and every \u201cT\u201d crossed.  \n\nBigDaddy is glaring daggers at GC, and basically tells Barry that if he wants to get paid, he\u2019s going to have to sue for the money.  \n\nBarry smiles, and slides his ace across the table. It\u2019s a Contractor\u2019s Lien against BigDaddy, FancyAss Restaurant, and Massive Realty Company, the owners of the building.  \n\nHere\u2019s the thing. FancyAss was owned by Internationally Famous Chef (IFC), who makes his living getting *Very Important People* to invest in opening a new restaurant. This is a place where they go to be *Very Important*, and bring their business contacts with them. After a short time, when the restaurant is the happening place in town, the investors sell the place, and cash out large. IFC sticks around, helps with the transition, and makes a percentage of the restaurant\u2019s profits for the use of his name. He\u2019s built an income stream with the investor\u2019s money, and the investors make a nice return.  \n\nOnly now they can\u2019t sell, with a lien on the place. And these investors have rabid fucking pitbulls as lawyers. Hell, some of them ARE lawyers.  \n\nSee you in court, BigDaddy. Only you\u2019re not facing Barry\u2019s lawyer, you\u2019re facing a whole new level of legal expertise. Have fun with that.  \n\nBarry got his revenge, and then withdrew service based on the disputed invoice. He\u2019s the only company allowed to service and install this brand of ADO as he has a protected territory from the manufacturer, and does seven figures worth of business with them a year. The only other companies anywhere nearby were warned off by the manufacturer, who even relayed the fact that BigDaddy had called them directly looking for service, and they referred BigDaddy to Barry.  \n\nBarry will definitely get paid, as it\u2019s a standard to hold back 10% of the payment to a construction company for a year, and the holdback will definitely cover the invoice. So FancyAss will pay Barry and then take it out of BigDaddy\u2019s holdback. Either that, or they will sue BigDaddy into dust, and force BigDaddy to cough up and settle the lien.  \n\nWho knows what company BigDaddy picked up to cover the ADO\u2019s. Barry has friends in the industry and warned them all off, but there are asshole competitors, and Barry didn\u2019t say a thing to them. Maybe BigDaddy is screwing over one of the competition, and what hurts his competition, helps Barry.  \n\nWhat makes this deliciously Pro? You think maybe, just maybe, Barry, who has decades of experience in the industry, might have had an Electrician friend that could show him the Electrical bid? And that maybe Barry knew from the beginning that there was no provision for 120v in either package? Or that the washroom was too small? Or that GC, a corner cutter, would take the easy way out and hook the ADO\u2019s into the air curtain?  \n\nWay to go, Barry. Nicely played.  \n\nTL;DR A subcontractor complies with a bid, to the letter, and covers his ass in all correspondence, General Contractor ends up paying big dollars for their error, allowing subcontractor to recover money he was screwed out of years ago.",

I didn't expect this to blowup as I was just reposting it in light of the tweet. This is my theory based on facts. Also a great timeline of rc involvement with GME. Gamestop future is very bright in the near term and future.  Not financial advice.\n\nReposting Merger DD\n\n**What's RC plan, does he have a plan?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Reverse Merger](https://preview.redd.it/e3snbmofv1271.png?width=1264&format=png&auto=webp&s=919faa2369537a443fc935d3c012f6a33d6c1d78)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is what I think Ryan Cohens plan is\n\nOk I have heard allot of talk about stock splits, reverse splits, dividends or crypto dividends ect on how RC can shake the shorts.\n\nNone of those really go the whole way. Reverse split is out of the question as the stock is not liquid enough, and there is legal questions surrounding the crypto dividend. [OVERSTOCK](https://www.coindesk.com/after-lawsuits-and-delays-overstock-hands-shareholders-digital-dividend)\n\nAlso none of these moves benefit Ryan Cohen and GameStop at the same time. They may hurt the shorts or help retail investors but none of the options help Gamestop and RC at the sametime.\n\nI have [Posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mwy324/can_ryan_cohen_increase_his_ownership_to_199/) and others have thought about RC buying more GameStop, after reviewing the filings **he can buy up to 20% of the company at any point.** This whole time I have been waiting for him to buy, and thinking that he is waiting for volume to dry up, or to save his ammo to protect the stock if the price starts to fall.\n\nbut there is a serious flaw in that thinking......it doesn't help Gamestop.\n\nI lay out the timeline of RC and GameStop below more in-depth below, but at this point RC has control of the board and the chairmanship, he doesn't need to buy anymore stock the way normal people do.\n\nGameStop, with the help of RC and his marry band of Apes has erased its long term debt (minus leases) and raised 555m (a nice down payment on the transformation)\n\nRyan Cohen wants to own more of GME, most owner/CEO own over 20% of the companies they run.\n\nHe is totally invested in the GameStop turnaround, the best thing he can do is a **Reverse Merger.**\n\nHe capitalizes RC ventures with allot of money (500m, 750m, 1.5b) he can even bring in other private investors.\n\nRC Ventures and GME merge, they create a Holding Company that they both merge into. The holding company is renamed Gamestop and eventually trades as GME under a **new CUSIP#**\n\n**How does it help Ryan Cohen**\\- He gets ownership of whatever % of the stock at the agreed upon merger price (it would be the same amount as if he bought on the open market)\n\nH**ow does it help Gamestop**\\- they actually get the **CAPITAL,** if Ryan buys on the open market they don't get the money they sold that stock when they issued it. this way Ryan gets to infuse the company with much needed cash and increase his ownership stake at the same time.\n\nYou are probable asking\n\nHOW DOES IT HELP APE - Did you gloss over the part about the CUSIP#...here read this\n\n[Example 1](https://groovevc.wordpress.com/2017/04/12/is-this-the-beginning-of-a-remarkable-short-squeeze/) or [https://theintercept.com/2016/09/24/naked-shorts-cant-stay-naked-forever/](https://theintercept.com/2016/09/24/naked-shorts-cant-stay-naked-forever/)\n\n\" Changing the stock cusip number results in each share with the old cusip number having to be exchanged for a share with the new cusip number, which causes each short position to have to prove the borrow. Naked short positions would be unable to comply and those positions could have to be covered by purchasing shares with the new cusip on the open market. \"\n\nNow the reverse split or the reverse merger has been tried before and it does squeeze the stock price a bit, but then it goes right back down. Typically this is because it is done on Penny Stocks and the shorts can simply cover as its not that expensive or there is not as many Naked shorts as people think.\n\nbut what if there is a ton of **NAKED SHORTS,** then those **SHORTS ARE FUCKED.** If they sold a bunch of shares naked and kept doing it without ever thinking they would need to be returned they would be foreced to buy a TON of GME under the new CUSIP #\n\n**ADDITION More research and DD need to be done on how a merger or reverse merger affects users on ETTORO**\nhttps://www.etoro.com/posts/0__entry__19ed9016-5e15-4642-be20-64b8dc9bb89f\nAdding alpha merger info from Etoro.  My take is not to worry if you are on Etoro, there would be a minimum 30 day period from the announcement of a merger to an actual merger, probably more. So the stock would squeeze during that period not after. Also any merger would cause a change in cusip number.\n\nRemember Citadel Securities is the DMM for GME right now if they change their cusip number they can change DMM OR CHANGE EXCHANGES.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SHortsplan was never to cover](https://preview.redd.it/wf27b5zmv1271.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d5deba3ced045bc5fc1f253eff80fcbded6c947)\n\nI have been writing a DD where I believe that Citadel and SUS has been stashing their Naked options sales or Naked short sales in [Sold not yet purchased liabilities](https://www.reddit.com/r/DDintoGME/comments/n6mj3h/knight_capital_groupthe_precursor_to_citadel_part/) which are Ballooning.

        "Title": "Biggest Payday of My Life for 2 Minutes of Work",
        "Body/Content": "Another tech story: I\u2019m a contractor at a big bank in New York City. No benefits but I\u2019m paid by the hour. I like the people I work for and while I realize I get paid well, I try to make sure they get their money\u2019s worth.\n\nOn the Friday before last (start to the three-day weekend), I was told by one of the managers (mine is out on vacation) that one of \u201cmy\u201dapplications was malfunctioning in production and that it absolutely needed to be fixed pronto. This application was tested to a crazy degree, so the first thing I did was call up the server admin and ask what was different between our test and production systems. After some prodding, I figure out that the production system consists of two clustered servers whereas the test server is all on its own. On the theory that the data isn\u2019t transferring between the paired servers fast enough for the next web page to be rendered (it\u2019s a survey application where the answer to one question determines the next question to be asked), I suggest checking the \u201csticky bit\u201d (which would ensure that when a person uses the application, they will \u201cstick\u201d to one server, to eliminate the data transfer problem.) \n\nThe admin (who\u2019s a friend of mine) tells me she can\u2019t make that change without *her* department\u2019s manager\u2019s approval, a kind of know-it-all guy. \n\nFine. I tell my substitute manager what I think the problem is (thinking he\u2019ll go to bat for me) and instead, he tells me to \u201cstay as long as it takes, including giving up my weekend to ensure it\u2019s working\u201d and he tells me I\u2019ll have to work it out with the department manager for the server group.\n\nLong story only slightly shorter, that guy proceeds to make my and his two employees\u2019 lives miserable all weekend. I keep suggesting the sticky bit, he keeps telling me \u201cthere\u2019s no way that\u2019s it\u201d and suggests dumb strategy after dumb strategy. I keep telling my substitute manager what\u2019s happening, he keeps telling me to work it out...and stay as long as I need to.\n\nFinally, late on Columbus Day, my admin friend says \u201cI\u2019m just going to try your idea without telling him.\u201d\n\nFixes the problem...less than two minutes effort.\n\nWhen my manager got back from vacation last week, he called me over to his desk. He had just gotten the bill from the contracting firm. He seemed pissed. I had billed for three extra 8 hour days.\n\nHim: \u201cI just have one question: where did you sleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the couch in the waiting room.\u201d\n\nHim: \u201cOK. Thanks.\u201d\n\nEarlier today, my manager came over with an envelope and when he handed it to me he said \u201cI\u2019d tell you to thank [substitute manager] and [server group manager] for this but since it came out of their budgets, maybe best not to. Don\u2019t spend it all in one place.\u201d\n\nCheck was for my regular pay plus, um, almost $18,000. My manager socked their budgets for time and a half from the end of business of Friday to open of business on Tuesday.\n\nWhen I told him later that I felt bad, he said: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t, you taught them a very valuable lesson in server technology and business management that they obviously missed.\u201d\n\nDid I mention my boss used to be a programmer himself?\n\n**Edit:** Gee, so this is transitory, temporary, low-level Reddit quasi-fame! ;-) I figure I\u2019d get a few comments at most, really I just didn\u2019t know who to tell besides my mom and all she kept saying was \u201cgood for you, honey!\u201d Weird week all around. To wrap up my couple minutes of quasi-fame and week of self-indulgence, here\u2019s the update:\n\nMy boss called me last night to say that his boss\u2019 boss would like to have lunch with me. I didn\u2019t think she knew my name but it\u2019s not really about my long weekend...that just reminded her I exist. :-/ In any case, they\u2019ve asked me to think seriously about coming on staff and they want me to create a position for myself. They\u2019ve proposed coming on staff before but the create-a-job thing is new. Mostly I\u2019ve resisted because the idea of managing others \u2014 and becoming one of *them* \u2014 makes my skin crawl. My manager said they\u2019ve been talking about it for a while. News to me.\n\nSo, that happened. \n\nAlso, apparently the \u201cbonus\u201d was my boss\u2019 idea but his boss and his boss\u2019 boss signed off on it because they didn\u2019t think it was fair and because it was a way of rewarding me for \u201ceverything I\u2019ve done\u201d (been here 5 years.) It\u2019s not the first favor they\u2019ve done for me either. Two years ago, they were told to cut consultants and they classified me as \u201cessential\u201d (I\u2019m really not, they just seem to like me) to keep me around until they could figure out how to keep me. So, anyway, I\u2019m a bit more comfortable with how things went down.\n\nI wasn\u2019t really expecting advice from everyone but it did get me thinking and just to wrap up this horrifically self-indulgent story, I decided to start a \u201cpotential future offspring\u201d investment account. My parents did a lot for me and if I have kids one day, I\u2019d like for them to feel lucky in this world. If I never wind up having kids, I\u2019ll gladly help someone else\u2019s kids feel a little lucky. It\u2019s not millions of dollars but it\u2019s enough of an unexpected windfall to start saving for that off right.\n\nLastly (and I was planning to do this anyway, now I can do just a bit more), once the taxes are figured out, I figure I\u2019ll give a generous but not crazy [donation](https://hispanicfederation.org/unidos/) to hurricane relief in P.R. bc it\u2019ll make me feel better about how fortunate I am generally and bc they\u2019re freaking Americans for God\u2019s sake (...and not trying for applause or sainthood. In fact, I have given much less to charity than I could...and I\u2019m superstitious enough to feel like after this week, I really have to avoid tempting the Fates.)\n\nThanks for sharing my weird week with me, Reddit. :-)\n\n**TL;DR**: Was told to spend my weekend in the office arguing with an uncooperative manager. Made $18k courtesy of my pissed-off, ex-programmer boss.",

        "Title": "Teemo Appreciation Thread",
        "Body/Content": "**TL;DR:** I think Teemo's okay.\n\nAround 2008, Riot decided they needed a lighter end to their spectrum of champions. A race, so to speak, of creatures that were more jovial in portrayal than the dark kind they had been pouring their resources into. Led by a Rioter known only as 'Ezreal,' they developed Him in the still Indie-company-sized studio of Riot Games.\n\nHim.\n\nGenesis.\n\nFrom Him, a new race would come to be. From the hairless and often explosive females to the oft-dramatic males for and against Bandle's safety, all with their own undertakings. Most won't remember Him as the lawless origin to the race called Yordles. To many, too many, He is but an image in the Mind's eye, of a moppish-yet-sturdy smile. For others, the image is a scope in the hands of He, capable explorer and scout. For me, it was the story of a log, a paw, and a vaulting motion towards the player--invitation, demonstration and warning all in one.\n\nWhen I was in the last year of high school, my friends introduced me to League of Legends. I don't have the wherewithal to remember what season I joined. What do I remember in those first few games among friends? We were in a skype call. After some, if I may admit it, boring matches, I fled to the store to find someone more entertaining than Annie and Warwick to play. \n\nI saw Him. And spoke words my friends couldn't hear for they were whispered between the creature before me, and my quivering lips.\n\n\"Oh my god, Teemo.\"\n\n\"I thought you hated the game,\" my friends teased in the days afterward. I'd laugh off the question and say,\n\n\"Top, please!\"\n\nThen lock in Teemo, the Swift Scout. A smile pressed across my lips as I previewed my several skins, admiring the way they changed the context of this... this thing, rapidly encroaching on my impressionable young mind. \n\nWhat was it about Him that made me so eager to play League? Soon enough, as my friends either stagnated or stopped playing altogether. The introduced became the tenured, though my advice wasn't useful to new players. All I knew how to do was play Him. \n\nQ. Blinding dart. The force of those lungs.\n\nW. Move Quick. The work of His legs.\n\nE. Toxic Shot. His ingenuity.\n\nR. Noxious Trap. A calling card. I dreamt of walking down a road one day and spotting one in my path. Returning it to him and receiving a thank you for my time. \n\nBut even in this domain I was left lacking, because the part of League that captivated me most was champ select... peering upon Teemo's splash, trying to capture the same feeling I had that first, blinding moment in high school.\n\nWhat had enamored me? I could see bits and pieces, yet a recollection of the entire artwork eluded me, and I began to grow frustrated and toxic. I risked being banned--after a two week warning, I realized I must go on a pilgrimage. On a road to discovery, to study Teemo and discover why this Yordle made me so passionate.\n\nAnd here I am today. Join me as we dissect what it means to be Teemo.\n\n*****\n\n**Part one:** a glimpse of his body.\n\nImagine, if you will, the lush jungle of Kumungu. A buzzing, hot place full of danger at every step, yet rewarding travelers with constant doses of serenity and fae beauty. It is hard to imagine every single wonder this jungle can provide, nor their extent. Already its tall palms, the gromps that hop in massive packs to avoid predators, the rolling stones called Krugs, all assault your ability to separate fact from fiction.\n\nWiping sweat off your brow, you stumble through the brush to emerge on a small clearing. The Kumungu hushes itself and you grow cautious, afraid of whatever laid in store in this sunny, almost picturesque relief. \n\nA campsite. You walk closer, setting down your things to inspect it. There is a small campfire, snuffed before dawn, and a swirl of broken twigs where a small body sat. \n\nAs your surroundings continue to swirl about you as if the scene has trapped you in the reverie of another person, the true remnants of this campsite are revealed. The safety of it all, the confidence of a settler to sleep alone in the Kumungu. You imagine the quiet happiness of a creature who has had the honor to tame the jungle, breathing breath and circulating the blood of an adventurer through his diminutive and constantly-aware body. You imagine its leavings, a bundle of tinder, a rock utilized as a pestle. \n\nIt sleeps in its own, victorious body. It survives with the intellect of its own mind. You glance back at your bag of man-made tools--and feel nothing but the worst scorn imaginable! What shame the scene drives in you, to be ever-reliant on the success of other men! You wish to lie prostrate right there in the middle of the clearing and plead, nay, pray for the same insight.\n\nStanding up from your journey into the mind of this legend, a noise breaks the spell. The bout of madness is over. You twist around to see what made the rustling.\n\nA chipper laugh. \"HAHEEUHEAU.\"\n\nGone. But all of that shameful energy has turned into determination. Leaving your pack on the ground, you deign to live as the animals do. \n\n*****\n\n**Part two:** to be a maid in his home.\n\n\"Excuse me, maid,\" Teemo calls from the back room of his humble home in Bandle City, \"I will be leaving again soon. Please leave my shoes outside my door.\"\n\nYour heart skips a beat. The Yordle, he, oh god, he just arrived home mere minutes ago. When accepting this job out of the classifieds, taking it for granted, an opportunity to travel, you never accounted for such a creature like the Swift Scout. \n\nLike Jane Eyre on her walk outside Thornfield, simply delivering mail and resuming her telltale boredom at a casual pace, your first sight of Teemo exploded the monotony decades hence. \n\nRushing inside, covered in dust. Bootprints trailing on the sandalwood floors--\"don't worry,\" you remember mumbling, \"I can clean it up.\"\n\n\"That's your job, right?\" Teemo asked. You wouldn't know, but you caught him in a jovial, rather than murderous, mood. \"I forgot, I haven't been home. Let's share a drink.\"\n\nThe two of you sat across from one another. Teemo poured Bandle bourbon into two glasses. The large pitcher sloshed forward and you caught him catching it... tendons underneath his furred arm tensing. \n\nYou weren't going to be able to keep this job, you surmise. \n\nTeemo carried the conversation on, while you imagined how the aftertaste of bourbon must feel on the back of his little throat. To think such a small, pernicious thing could knock more drinks down than you...\n\nAnd at this trying time, where you almost lost it all, he hadn't asked you to move his shoes.\n\nYou near the boots of swiftness, breathing heavy. It takes a moment's preparation to reach down and grab them. \n\nYour fingers slip into them, and are greeted by warm air. The heat hasn't yet left the boots. Oh, Christ above!!  They are still hot from use! From pounding, over, over, and over, over, and over, on the dirt ground underneath Teemo's feet!!\n\nTeemo shoots out of his bath, throwing a towel over himself. \"Is everything okay?\" He cries. \"Did you slip?\"\n\nAll his visage does is earn another howl from your addled mind, yet so much panic forces you into a cooled state. Everything slows down while Teemo awaits an answer, you on the floor, he dripping wet with a head full of shampoo-bubbles.\n\nAn offer begins to form on your lips.\n\nBut then the scene ends.\n\n*****\n\n**Part Three:** His Fingers.\n\n*Dear Riot,*\n\nI heard you were changing the champion portraits. I have something to ask.\n\nCan you please make it so we can choose what part of the skin becomes the portrait? I really want my portrait to be Omega Squad Teemo's fingers. There is something about the singular makeup of his furred digits that inspires me to play better. My breathing becomes heavy, as if I am running a marathon at record pace, and my reaction times turn frenzied--almost as good as a scripter! When I imagine Omega Squad Teemo's fingers curled around my, sorry, his dart gun, I position better, I am more positive in games towards my fellow summoners.\n\nCan we do an AMA with the League artist who designed Teemo's fingers? I want to know why they chose that enticing groove, the perfect length of each follicle, the same-colored claws! Jesus Christ, I can imagine the thin veins running beneath those killer points, almost as much as I can smell Teemo's fingers curling under my chins mere moments before he SNAPS. MY. NECK.\n\nBut then there is something else. The rotating game mode... Zigg's fingers are right out in the open, naked but for the pen in the clutch of his paws. Oh god, who draws these Yordles and their fingers? Have I said fingers a lot? Sorry.\n\nImagine finding one of their perfect strands on your pillowcase, or floating in the broth of your chicken Campbell soup. You pick it up, holding it against a fluorescent light, and see its golden integrity in full. I want to have this moment happen forever and ever. If only you would give me the CHANCE. PLEASE, PLEASE GIVE ME JUST A GLIMPSE OF OMEGA SQUAD TEEMO'S RESPLENDANT DIGITS! I CANT HOLD BACK ANYMORE!!!\n\nEvery time I am in school, at dinner, alone in my room, those fingers crawl under my clothing and pull me down into the fiery throes of passion.\n\nPlease, please, please give me this feature or I don't know what will happen to me next.\n\n*****\n\n**Part Four:** A doughy dream. \n\nYou are eating pancakes at mom's. There is a television on the kitchen counter, where she catches up on the latest news. The nonstop coverage of some political debate finally shuts up for commercials. \n\nStill groggy, the popping colors and loud noises of these ads entertain you. That is, until a cereal ad breaks away into a scene for Pillsbury biscuits. \n\nYour mind snaps out of half-sleep, so sudden your mom gives a peripheral glance to see what's the matter. \n\nIt was like any other commercial from Pillsbury, involving a mascot selling some new brand of processed dough.\n\nYet, and yet... the Pillsbury Doughboy had been replaced by Teemo. You spit out your mouthful of cereal back into your bowl, lean in, start to go off-kilter with fascination.\n\n\"Press my belly again!\" Teemo pleads. \n\nThe stay-at-home mom in the commercial complies, a skeptical smile on her face as she presses in the scout's stomach.\n\n\"Hoh-oh! Hee hee hee!\"\n\nSliiiide. Crack. Did your hand just act on its own, breaking your mom's expensive, favorite ceramic bowl?\n\nShe says something and rushes off to fetch the broom. Now she has left you alone with Pillsbury Teemo.\n\nAs you thought, the sly creature had been waiting for such a distraction. That the two of you met here was no matter of circumstance--Teemo immediately breaks away from the T.V mom, then gestures for you to come closer.\n\n\"Would YOU like to press my tummy?\" Teemo asks.\n\nYou stand up, still with enough sense to avoid the broken ceramic. Teemo, the T.V mom, both wave you on like you're a marathon runner finishing the last leg of the race. Five fingers battle for which will do the honor, until you are sure the anticipation will break your hand. \n\nThen.\n\nFizz. That was the static of the television prickling the fur on your index finger. Smiling, dumb, you press Teemo's exposed belly.\n\n\"Hee hee hee, come with meee!\"\n\nYou are sucked inside the commercial! The other boys, real jocks and always needed a snack after their big game, stand aside for Teemo's honored guest. \n\n\"Make me small like you,\" you beg. Teemo waves an arm and you start to notice the counter grow in size. \"Yes, yes, yes!\"\n\nOh man, it is the best time, the greatest time, an excursion so pleasurable you think it might throw you into an aneurism. Thank you, god! Thank you, Pillsbury! Thank you, thank you--your feet makes small impressions in the dough as you and Teemo play tag, giggling like schoolgirls, while all the other members of your new family urge you on. Teemo tugs you down into the dough and the two of you snuggle together.\n\n\"Are you ready to be together forever?\" He asks.\n\nYou give a muted nod, somehow knowing what comes next. T.V mom lifts up the tray of biscuits, telling the kids whoever behaves the best gets the 'specialest' biscuit.\n\nAs the tray enters the oven, the scorching heat melting the skin on your backside, you wake up. \n\nReal mom is crossing her arms, angry. You fell face-first into your bowl of cereal again. The Pillsbury Doughboy, no longer Teemo, dances away on the screen.\n\nMom turns to get a napkin.\n\nThe Doughboy winks at you.\n\n*****\n\n**Part Five:** Playing against other Yordles.\n\nWhen I play against other Yordles, my blood runs hot.\n\nTeemo is the true owner of the top lane. Kled is a reject, someone better of driving him and his stupid lizard off of a cliff! And Lulu, that perennial little brat has no place anywhere, let alone in the Rift's proudest lane.\n\nTristana can rocket-jump straight into a wood-chipper. Rumble is a college drop-out, and Corki doesn't even look like a Yordle. \n\nOne day I went Teemo top against Kled. It was supposed to be an easy game, considering I was a gold III smurfing in Silver II. \n\nI got into a one-on-one with Kled, the battle going my way until the freak jumped off his mount at the right time, dodging a blinding dart. I became blinded by tears as my screen turned grey.\n\nThen again. And again. Teemo, my animus, was dying and it was my fault. The game ended at fifteen minute and I knew, not for the last time, I failed Him. My eyes went to my personal shrine to the scout, and I swore my framed picture of his face frowned with dissatisfaction. My heart palpitated. \n\nRight away I rushed to the pet store and bought myself two things: a rat and a lizard. My mind was a haze of fury and upset, yet the pet store owner let me get them anyway, and even smiled at me on my way out. Almost knowingly...\n\nI rushed back into my home, plopping my new pets in front of the shrine. I brandished a small letter-opener, then lifted the lizard over my portrait of a Teemo.\n\n\"You love Skarl so much,\" I whispered, slipping my letter-opener under the beast's throat. \"You love him, Kled. Well, I-I.. I...\"\n\nI fell to the ground, sobbing. \n\n\"I can't do it anymore!\" I yelled, sobbing. \"No more sacrifices, Teemo!\" The truth was, I loved all Yordles. Teemo shouldn't ever ask me to harm what was made from His flesh, His blood.\n\n\"Quite right,\" agreed a voice from behind me. I whirled around to find the pet-shop owner. \"Finally, you understand.\"\n\nThe rat and lizard scurried under the couch in fright, as their handler shrank before my very eyes! It was He! Devil Teemo!\n\nI fell prostrate, bowing to my Lord, crying tears of joy and penance. \n\nDevil Teemo gently took my blade away. \"You've done well to learn the value of all life,\" he admitted. \"I've paid close attention to your journey, first thinking to punish you... then to watch and see if you changed. And, bless the 'Shroom, you did.\"\n\n\"T-Te-ee-mo!\" I wailed. \n\nThe devil smiled devilishly. \"Say, did your really build AD last game? For that... I think I'll make you my personal servant for life.\"\n\nI offered my hands to him, and he put me in shackles made of silver. They were loose enough to not hurt me weak, brittle wrists. \n\nHe dragged me into a portal, and my days on the Rift, rather than watching over it, were over.\n\n*****\n\n**Part Six:** My VR Teemo experience.\n\nThe year is 2026. Oculus and everybody got their business together and figured out true Virtual Reality. The games published can now be called, unironically, triple A. Funnily enough, all they needed to do was provide a way for the game console to 'plug' into the player. The bridged, LAN connection of sorts allows the player to experience a much more visceral and fast experience.\n\nOf course, this comes with dangers. Games are now labelled 'rated M, male, 20-45' or 'T, for females aged 16-32.' This is because the bridged connection provides unique, situational sensations that certain biologies are unable to comprehend. Rule-breakers report a few... strange occurrences not available to the public.\n\nYou know the risks of what you are about to do. Yet you have already stolen your sister's VR device, as well as her host of games on the Steam cloud. You went through the trouble of piecing her password together from her diary, so you can access the 'family unfriendly' portion of her library.\n\nIt started that day you peeked inside her headset. That single image plagued the back of your lids until you preferred to be blind than... than to see it again without having the capability to interact.\n\nToo hungry to put it off anymore, you lift the VR helmet onto your head and plug the USB 7.0 jack into your armpit. By using brainwaves you enter your sister's password and access your chosen game in a nanosecond: Miracle Simulator--Yordle DLC.\n\nRight away the neuraltransmitters indicate a squeezing force on your left hand. You swivel to the left, and right away your breath is stolen.\n\n\"Ow,\" Teemo says, laughing through a grimace. \"Not so hard, honey.\" \n\nYou look down and see the sky-blue hospital sheets. The constant beep of a heartbeat monitor bumps in your ears. A virtual doctor towers above your body, and you quickly get into bed to better complete the experience. This is definitely the game your sister was playing.\n\n\"We're going to be a family?\" You whisper into the mic, braving the voice features. \n\nTeemo loads a response. \"Yes. A girl, remember?\"\n\nYou frown. \"VR, load up situation change. Boy.\"\n\n\"A b-b-boy, remember?\" Teemo crackles, changing his response. \"I'm retiring from scouting, getting a seat on the Bandle counsel. We'll never be apart, promise.\"\n\nThe Yordle breaks composure, resting his head on you to weep. \"I'm so proud of you, of us.\"\n\nThe VR presses forward a spongy substance to soak up your tears. They flow freely. \"Me too. I'm so happy to be here with you.\"\n\nThe doctor finally has his own voice line. \"Okay, here we go. Get ready to push--\"\n\nA fierce disturbance coaxes a howl of pain from you! The hospital room flashes red as the sensation the game wants to deliver, your body is frankly unable to answer. Teemo's distorted, pixelated face gives you a concerned look.\n\n\"I-Is p-p-p-play one okay?\" \n\n\"Yes!\" You shriek to the heavens. \"But exit, exit game!\"\n\nIn the last moment, the AI grins and waves you off.\n\nYou fall out of your bed hyperventilating. The ribbons of your conscience ravel back into their rightful places. That experience almost killed you! \n\n\"I'm okay,\" you breathe, \"I'm okay, I'm alive.\"\n\nIt was worth it, though.\n\nYou rest a hand on your stomach, and feel a little kick.\n\nIt was worth it--in more ways than anyone will ever know.\n\n*****\n\n**Part seven:** Dating Profile\n\nSingle and ready to mingle! Teemo, the Swift Scout.\n\nI'm a scout who lives in Bandle City, and am looking for a light, honest-to-heart relationship. Applicants ought to know right away that to get to me, you have to get through my BFF Tristana. We're thicker than thieves, on the job and outside of it! \n\nLikes: long walks in the jungle, my work, sharing a drink with friends.\n\nDislikes: burst damage, hard CC, people who can't take a joke, drama.\n\nOne thing to know about me: I'm a Yordle. You might have guessed it from my profile image, lol. That means I'm shorter, and more emotional than some human or cat-person or Zaunite project. I break down at sad movies and want to beat up the villains in my favorite action flicks (John Wick 2 and Shaolin Soccer, bee-tee-dubs :) ) \n\nWhat I want most in a partner: honesty and commitment. Someone who doesn't underestimate this scout's code.\n\nMy passion: microbrewing, believe it or not.\n\nA quirk: I go to work shirtless ;)\n\nSo if you think I am a fit, let me know ASAP: a stud like me can't be on the market long, right?\n\n*****\n\n**Part Eight:** a reply to Teemo's dating profile.\n\n*Dear Teemo,*\n\nYour body is so chiseled--gah, let me restart this missive xD \n\nI can tell from your eyes you have suffered a great hurt in your past, and I cannot help but desire to mend you. A little bit about me: I am a budding warrior from Demacia, known for dispensing justice. Yet no one, not even my own sister, ever asks me to dispense sound advice. There's something so isolating to living in a bubble, you know? I want to make mistakes with someone, get cuffed and put into the backseat of a police car with someone.\n\nI read that you're passionate, oftentimes in the wrong way, and I see potential. Potential for the two of us to grow and flourish; live our lives together in imperfection. Will you hold me at night and whisper \"it's okay\" after I give you a tearful rendition of how I killed a six-year-old Noxian child? How I surprised here from inside a bush and drove my blade through her chest, and into her stuffed animal? People see me as larger than life, but I am so much smaller than a Yordle.\n\nPlease, deliver me from this constant grief and my devotion is yours to do with as you please. \n\nHope to hear from you soon, xD\n\nGaren.\n\n*****\n\n**Part Nine:** Teemo's reply to Garen.\n\n*Hello Garen of Demacia*,\n\nYou sound brave enough to me. Hope you're man enough for some extreme hiking in the Kumungu HAHEUAHAUAH\n\nhope 2 see u soon,\n\nTeemo\n\n*****\n\n**Part Ten:** Teemo sacrifices himself in a hostage crisis\n\nI regret to inform Bandle City that, at 1:25 PM Saturday, Teemo the swift scout succumbed to injuries endured while protecting the Yordle people.\n\nCaptain Teemo, even on days off, was on duty. It was no different that fateful morning at the Bandle Mint, our largest bank. When Veigar broke through the glass windows and demanded hostages, it was Teemo who withdrew his concealed firearm, a blowgun, and saved the lives of countless citizens. \n\nWe cannot guess as to what went through his head in the fight that ensued. But we hope that we, the people, were grateful enough to the scout that he had nothing but gratitude in his valorous last moments. The shard of dark magic that took his life has done the world the greatest disservice. Even its thrower, Veigar, has begged Bandle's forgiveness for removing this brave warrior from our charge.\n\nTeemo is survived by his maid, as well as his close friend Garen. As denoted in his will, Poppy will lay him to rest in the Grove Cemetary tomorrow evening, after a procession befitting his brave soul. \n\nTo everyone grieving, remember that Teemo did everything in life for the betterment of your day. That he would not want to see tears, but smiles on the childrens' faces while they go towards, again, a promising and bright future.\n\nThank you, Captain Teemo, for your duty. Your loss is gonna sting.\n\n*****\n\n**Part Eleven:** Teemo's valiant return to life. \n\nUrgot knew he was going to need even more power to fight the chem barons. More than his weaknesses permitted. There was but one option, gleaned by him from a lab report never meant to cross his eyes. A scout named Teemo had been shipped to Zaun for containment. While his kind weeped, Teemo was merely put into an unstoppable rest by Veigar's curse. \n\nThe dreadnought knew how to break such spells. Crawling forward on crablike legs, he peered over the Yordle.\n\nSuch surprisingly toned arms, and a stomach taut with muscle... Urgot never considered the ultimate life form would exist without outside... construction. \n\nNot able to resist the urge, he pounded the 'awake' button to Teemo.\n\nLightning pierced the pollution clouds above Zaun, went on to strike the antenna-tower! Urgot laughed joyously as Teemo's body flailed, receiving enough electricity to light all of Piltover for a week straight. Alive, Teemo was becoming alive!\n\nThe Yordle gasped, shooting up on his stone bed. He immediately tugged loose the IV's in his arm and stared at the dreadnought, trying to figure out what was going on.\n\nUrgot found it unbefitting of the ultimate life-form to be so surprised.\n\nThen Teemo softly grinned.\n\n\"Thanks for that, big guy,\" he said. \"Wow... look at those arms...\"\n\nThe mechanical man wiggled in embarrassment. \"Oh, t-these old things? Weak, the pinnacle of human weakness, you know hard it can be to find good augments around here.\"\n\n\"No, no! I bet you could break a watermelon with these cannons.\"\n\nIn the hours that came, Urgot forgot all about killing the chembarons and taking over Zaun. Instead, history changed. Teemo saved the world by having a long discussion about thick arms with Urgot.\n\n*****\n\n**Part Twelve:** Teemo eats a poptart\n\nMale Yordles have slightly protruded muzzles that make their mouths into tunnels of tiny, adorable, razor sharp teeth. Of course, Teemo isn't thinking about his incredible body, especially not with the aroma of a s'mores poptart right under his pink nose.\n\nYou, his maid, quit dusting his trophy shelves, distracted to an exxtreme. You risk a glance over--the scout is preparing to take a bite, just setting down the Bandle tribune. \n\n\"You know,\" Teemo says, delaying the poptart. \"I had a dream about baked goods. I was stuck in some magic box, with giant humans...\"\n\n'Eat it,' your mind begs. 'Please, for the love of everyone, take a bite out of your poptart.' After the great scare that was his 'death,' and subsequent resurrection in Zaun, you needed this. \n\n\"You look famished,\" you comment. \"Eat your food, m'lord.\" Oh, and how sly you think you are! Teemo grins, knowing full-well that you have a penchant for noticing the little things.\n\nHe turns his chair over to you. Stuck against the shelves there is nowhere to look other than at him. \n\nTeemo lifts the poptart to his mouth. He bites it.\n\nYou watch as his cute incisors tear apart the cracked outside of the poptart. Then the gooey marshmallow comes: a strand sticks between his right canine and far, top-right molar. How far will it stretch? Mmm... how far, darn it?!\n\nUnable to stand alone, you swing back to clutch one of Teemo's trophies--a statue of him leaping over a log, a Nature's Friend award for saving the Kumungu jungle. \n\nGlomp, crick, glomp. Chew, chew, chew. You think you've fared the worst of it. Then he stops with his mouth open to breathe, making a show of it just to brutalize your poor, poor sensibilities! A crumb escapes and crawls away on the wooden floor, broken.\n\n\"Ah, it's so good,\" he mumbles through the mouthful. \"As a good scout, I ought to finish this piece of my rations, and continue to the next. But this.. this bite is more scrumptious, somehow?\"\n\n\"Stop!\" You yell. \"No more, I yield, I yield!\"\n\nJust then, Garen breaks into the room. He is unhappy.\n\n\"What are you doing, dear?\" Garen asks. \"Don't tell me...\"\n\nTeemo leans back and swallows. You watch the poptart mush go down into his gullet and the spell breaks, thank the Mothership. \"Merely entertaining our maid.\"\n\nIf anyone else sat where Teemo did, Garen might have lectured them. Yet the devil is far too charming. \n\nThe Demacian warrior takes a seat. \n\n\"Well,\" he says, \"we have a long hike today. Eat your food.\"\n\nYour clutch your own head in consternation. Not another bite...\n\n*****\n\n**Part thirteen:** Leemo\n\nNOTE: this section is not about Teemo, but his brother I created, Leemo. Although related by blood, they are dangerous and devilish in different ways.\n\nLeemo was born in darkness, which is thought to be the reason for his dark velvet coat. Unlike the light-son Teemo, Leemo was cast away by his parents to live in the Deathcage Orphanage, an orphanage where even infants must fight to survive. \n\nFight he did. His first kill was upon two snakes, who attacked him in hopes of poisoning his strong body. Then two bulls, who attacked him in hopes of poisoning his strong mind. Then two horses, who attacked him in hopes of poisoning his strong resolve.\n\nLeemo went on to become a freelance assassin. He has wavy purple fur that creates a human-like part over his brow. He never looks happy except in private when he finds a picture of his beloved, Jasmine, who perished in the HexTech wars.\n\nUnlike Teemo, Leemo is dangerous both on and off the battlefield. Say one thing wrong against him, like try to bully him, and he will beat you up. He likes to drink blood for breakfast, eat baby deer for dinner. Sometimes you can find the purple Yordle pondering the meaningless existence of life atop a stone gargoyle, or photoshopped onto the front cover of my Shadow the Hedgehog Videogame. \n\nIt is foretold that the two brothers Teemo and Leemo will meet one day. Even so Leemo is my original character and I love him devoutly, I know Teemo will kill his brother in cold blood. The true 'original' characters is too pure, too powerful for any foolish iteration to improve upon. I cry knowing my precious and brooding Leemo is destined for the slaughterhouse.\n\nTeemo, if you are reading this, please spare Leemo. The sweetest wine is but one flavor, and Leemo is the flavor I partake in when you are busy. Sorry. So sorry. Big sorry.\n\n*****\n\n**Part fourteen:** Team Liquid gets new management.\n\n\"Gimme back my bobblehead!\" Piglet yelled, jumping up and down with his arms outstretched.\n\nDardoch tittered, continued his mean game. The Teemo bobblehead, a precious heirloom to the marksman, shook its head 'no' in disappointment. \"You will never get it back. I hate you, you play to lose.\"\n\nLocodoco, their coach, did nothing to alleviate the situation--instead, his grating laughter made it all the worse. \"Fools, stop fighting, you guys are idiots who won't listen to me.\"\n\n\"Idiots!\" Cried Team Liquid's manager from the doorway. \"Listen up. You are all very naughty so we have gotten the best to coach you. I had to sign a contract in my own blood.\"\n\nAll the toxic players in the room cocked their head to the side, confused. So basically everyone except TL's support cocked their head to the side, confused.\n\n\"Ay ay ay,\" the manager groaned. \"Look down.\"\n\nDown by their manager's knees was none other than Devil Teemo! Piglet's eyes lit up with sardonic glee. At last, justice would be served to this naughty jungler.\n\nTeemo leaned on the doorway and smiled, knocking fear and titillation into the hearts of the young team. Locodoco perked up in his seat. \n\n\"You are no Tristana, though,\" the coach whispered, unable to argue against his heart. \"And yet, so striking...\"\n\n\"Trust me,\" Devil Teemo said in his demonic voice, \"I get that a lot.\"\n\n\"No way!\" Dardoch cried. \"We just teamed with Disney. this makes no sense.\"\n\n\"You think the devil himself and Disney aren't close friends?\" The way his long, pointed claws carved itno the door forced Dardoch to shut up. \"You have been a sinner, Dardoch. Some might call you the Michael Jordan of League of Legends, switching teams so often, except you haven't actually won a tournament.\"\n\nThe jungler flinched.\n\n\"I wonder what your true 'breaking point' is. Consider yourself replaced.\" Teemo lifted out a single finger and flicked it up. A trap door opened beneath Dardoch, dragging the Team Liquid player into the fiery depths of League of Legends elo hell. Piglet cried with such joy that his voice cracked. Dardoch's last gesture was to drag his nails across the carpet before being sucked into infinite torture.\n\nOut from the flames rose a new jungler. A gaunt and humble student of Teemo.\n\nTheRainMan.\n\n\"TheRainMan?!\" Shouted Piglet. \"No, it cannot be, he was made irrelevant years ago.\"\n\n\"I used to live a quiet life, being toxic in games and sacrificing small animals to my Lord,\" TheRainMan explained. \"One day, I found the strength to stop. Teemo has helped me remain strong ever since.\"\n\nDevil Teemo nodded. \"Prove yourself to them, my servant.\"\n\nNearby, Reignover was losing a game of League as per usual. TheRainMan pointed a single digit, which by dark magics became furred, long. A yellow bolt shot forth from his fingernail, hitting Reignover's screen. In an instant the camera broke away from the player's champion, panning towards the enemy nexus. It exploded.\n\nTeam Liquid's manager gave a toothy grin. Disney had given him the power to change the fabric of league itself.\n\n*****\n\n**Part Fifteen:** A bit of his blood\n\nYou sit there, reminiscing on your school paper assignment. This dissertation will decide whether or not you become the Bandle scientist your parents want you to be. \n\nThe subject of your study is a simple one, yet intrinsically deep by its execution: is Teemo's scarf a part of his body, or a part of his outfit? \n\nPencil in hand, you ponder the question. There is but seventy-two hours left to write, seventy-two hours to do an assignment said to take several weeks.\n\nOnce again you drift to those long, red strands. If it was so simple as reaching forward and touching the beautiful silk pictured in your memory! The great Yordle, Teemo, is yars away, looking through books without a clue you're studying him. Sighing, you resign yourself to abject failure, putting away your papers. When, in the corner of your eye, you spot a strange substance by the shelves. \n\nThe allure of the red liquid brings you closer to Teemo than ever before. Close enough to hear the Yordle curse under his breath and say four syllables that set your heart to floundering.\n\n\"Ow,\" Teemo cries, \"papercut!\" The Yordle walks away without another word.\n\nThe blood rests on the paper of the book. The book's title? Who cares...\n\nThis is the blood of Teemo. A deep, red marker of the vivacious creature's existence. In the quiet, unoccupied annals of the Bandle library, Teemo unwittingly left it in your charge. What will you do with it?\n\nTouch it. There is enough there to get a full drop to form on the end of your pinky finger. It glistens red, and feels thicker in content than your, or anyone else's blood. You almost smell the scout's outdoorsy lifestyle in its formation.\n\nNot giving it a second thought you pop your pinky into your mouth.\n\nLights of the entire rainbow hit you! In a second you find yourself strapped into a seat, pen let free! \n\nThe euphoria of Teemo's blood gives you a lust for learning, a lust for all things in life. A mere drop grants you the rarest insight into the Yordle's scarf.\n\nIt is both a part of him and a part of his outfit. An identity and a disguise, a mark of how he kills enemies then drinks with friends. Line after line after line--by the time you start to come down from the high, your dissertation is done.\n\nBut Teemo has found you panting at one of the tables. He frowns, concerned.\n\n\"You drank my blood, didn't you?\" Teemo inspected his own finger, still bleeding from the papercut. \"The addiction is so great, if we don't wean you off, you might die.\"\n\nYou nod. That is fine. It was worth ultimate bliss. \n\nBut the Yordle has no plans to let an innocent die due to his perfection. He hold out his arm. \"I want you to pace yourself. It's okay...\"\n\nYour memory begins to blacken and fade out just as you eagerly lift his hand towards your mouth.\n\nYou see many things in your sleep. A tray of biscuits, a strange machine with many cords, a missive to Riot about fingers. You see a devilish him, a purple him, a him that coaches Team Liquid. You see floating poptarts and hot shoes. You realize how Teemo is an inter-dimensional gift sent to those who need someone to love. An animus. An inspirer. The genesis. As reality rips you away from this endless paradise, Teemo drags you towards his world for one last thing. Your lips finally meet. It is too indescribable, to inexplicable.\n\nWhen you awake, Teemo has left you to your own devices. You stand up and quietly, pleasantly, resume your day, content to put away all that has happened.\n\n*****\n\nI finish these words with the greatest joy. Finally my love has been explained, to both myself and to the world. Some will comment accusations like 'have you no shame,' to which I answer that I have plenty of shame, but only for holding back this long.\n\nTeemo, if you ever come before me, I adore you. You are my everything, my alpha and omega squad. If it comes to be that we ever can hold hands, know that nothing will ever separate us. Know that, even in the meanest thunderstorm, I will bury my face in your neck-scarf and expect safety, as you expect loyalty from me. We will be together, we will be... complete.\n\nThank you Riot 'Ezreal' for designing the champion. Thank you Riot Games for allowing him in your game, League of Legends. Thank you to the community that plays, whose collective thoughts and desires coagulated into this post. On my lips I summarize all my love:\n\nOh my god... Teemo.\n\nPhew! Glad that's over. Now that Teemo's out of the way, let me tell you guys how much I *love* Twitch...",

        "Title": "The Aunt Who Took In Her Abused Niece, New Updates (Sept 19, '22)",
        "Body/Content": "This is a new update to a previously posted story. There are actually 3 new updates. If you don't need to read the first 3 parts that has already been posted to BORU, I have marked the newer ones with \ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34's so you can skip to them. I consider this story ongoing so we might get more updates.\n\n\nOriginally posted by u/Mano_Mama3510 in r/AmItheAsshole. \n\n\nTrigger warnings: child abuse, violence\n\n\n\n [Original post August 10th](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wkvvyp/aita_for_not_giving_my_nephew_his_birthday_gift/)\n\n\n\nJust bear with me for a moment.\n\n\nMy (29f) nephew, Josh (12m), is quite spoilt. His parents, my brother and SIL show blatant favoritism towards him over his younger sister Lou(9f). As a result, sadly Josh has grown a little entitled. He also is quite mean to his younger sister because his parents never believe her when she tells him what he's done to her stuff. Now, I'm usually very strict and when the kids are with me for a weekend, Josh is usually on his best behavior. Now, Josh's birthday was yesterday. Lou had a spelling bee last week and she got first prize. Her parents brushed it off but I was very happy for her because she spent hours learning each word and I was very proud. So when I took the kids day before Josh's birthday so he could pick out a gift for his bday, I got Lou a stuffed animal as a 'you did great!'. Josh picked this game that he's been wanting.\n\n\nThe birthday party was yesterday and when I went to their house, Lou had been grounded and was not allowed to attend and the two friends she had invited were also sent back home. I thought it was extreme and asked what she had done. Turns out that Josh and her argued over the tv remote and Josh went to her room and destroyed her stuffed animal that I gave her and told her she didn't deserve it. Lou screamed at him and my brother got angry with her 'temper tantrum' and had her pick up the pieces of the stuffed animal and throw them in the trash ALL THE WHILE SHE CRIED. She was then grounded.\n\n\nBtw, Josh's best friend was the one who spilled the beans to me and also told me that Josh goaded his parents into the punishment. I was furious and refused to give Josh his birthday present, telling him he didn't deserve it for being mean to his sister. I also told off my SIL and brother that they're growing insanely cruel towards their young daughter.\n\n\nNow my family is pissed that I refused to give Josh his birthday gift.\n\n\nSO, AITA\n\n\nTLDR; nephew picked on sister and I refused to give him his bday present\n\n\u200b\n\nEDIT: I have picked up my niece from my brother's house this morning. I called him and told him if she's being so rude to her brother, then maybe she should stay with me a couple of days to clam down (had no other choice but to say this. had to get her out of there). I got her a massive teddy bear which she's keeping in my house and I took her out to get Mcdonalds so she's smiling. But I am looking for a more permanent solution\n\n\n\n[1st Update 6 days later](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mano_Mama3510/comments/wq6s1u/update_aita_for_not_giving_my_nephew_his_birthday/) \n\n\nIt's been a hell of a week. First of all, I want to say thank you for all the kind comments and messages. I've read all of them. I only managed to respond to some because I was pretty overwhelmed over the whole thing. There was a lot going on as well.\n\n\nAs you can tell from my other posts, I'm in the middle of switching careers, so I simply don't have the funds to support my niece. And by that, I mean no one is going to give me my niece to foster because my income is low. I'm a freelance romance writer and that doesn't really generate a lot of income. I say this because I did seek out advice from social services in my country and they just shook their head at me. But I'll get to that later.\n\n\nOn to the actual update, I did end up taking my niece with me for a few days and I sat her down and talked to her once she was calm. There were a lot of things that were happening in that house that I was not aware of. My nephew bullies her and my brother thinks its funny when she cries. A few months ago, my niece had an accident and fractured her left arm. I was told she slipped down the stairs. She is clumsy so I thought that was that. Turned out her brother pushed her down the stairs as a prank and my brother laughed while she was screaming in pain. I verified the story from a neighbor who told me that she ended up taking her to hospital. Her father was apparently shouting at her to stop making a racket when she wouldn't stop screaming in pain.\n\n\nI lost it at that.\n\n\nI asked her if her mom knew. She said yes.\n\n\nNow, my childhood was pretty dark but not like this.\n\n\nI called my parents and asked them about this incident and a couple others and at first they hee-hawed, we don't know, blah, blah, and then my mom admitted she knew and that it was just kids being kids.\n\n\nI just saw red at that point.\n\n\nThis whole week I've been gathering any bit of evidence I can find. Finally, I invited over my brother and his wife. I told them that if they didn't get their shit together, I was posting everything on social media. I was going to email it to their companies, friends, whatnot (thank you to whomever suggested this). At first my brother was furious and when he tried to attack me, I pointed towards the camera I have in my living room. I was so angry that I felt like I was numb. I knew that this would destroy my relationship with my entire family but they left a little girl screaming on the bottom of the stairs and my brother laughed. I can't get that image out of my head.\n\n\nI told them I could either call the social services in our country and get Lou taken from them, or they could give her to me. The problem with this threat is that if I went the social services route, I would lose Lou as well. I told them if they don't want a daughter, they can give her to me. They can pretend she never existed. I was just speaking very quickly at that point. I don't even remember what i said. I would take over her expenses, etc, except for her health insurance and school fees. I told them they would never have to look at her again. I just kept talking.\n\n\u200b\n\nMy SIL started crying of how I was taking her child from her. I admittedly got angry over that and reminded her she wanted to abort Lou when she was pregnant. I was legit angry crying at that moment. I wanted to hit them. My brother was just silent. He was actually considering it.\n\n\u200b\n\nI told them it was better than having their dirty laundry aired in public because if it did, both kids would be removed from their house. It was blackmail but I had no options.\n\n\u200b\n\nThey said they'd think about it but Lou is with me for now. My SIL was pretty nasty about it too. in her words 'keep the little 'sl**'.\" All in my language ofc. I don't know how she can refer to her daughter like this but honestly i don't give a shit. My friend is a lawyer and he's told me to get a voice message from them that Lou is going to stay with me. My SIL said this over the voice note.\n\n\u200b\n\nLou hasn't mentioned going home. She doesn't talk about her parents. Yesterday, she and I went out and brought this lavender color paint and we painted my entire guestroom for her. I've decided to pick up more projects so that i can start saving for her. I did have some money set aside for a potential college fund for her. But I'll be picking up more work to save more and give her a comfortable life.\n\n\u200b\n\nI did get calls from my parents, shouting at me. I closed the phone on them. the only person who is supportive is my cousin. He said that if social services do get involved, he can take Lou in and I can move closer to them or something. I don't know.\n\n\u200b\n\nLou is just quiet. She's happy sometimes and sometimes she's just quiet. I fear she suffered more abuse in that house than she's letting on. My lawyer friend recommended a child therapist so I've booked a session for Monday. It's been three days and no call from my brother and SIL. My parents call every now and then to yell at me but they yell at me either way so whatever. I feel like this might work because both brother and SIL saw the post I had written out as a draft with pictures and evidence. It was extreme enough that they would suffer damage at their jobs. And news channels in my country eat this shit up especially if it happens in an educated household.\n\n\u200b\n\nI don't know. I know blackmail is wrong. But I don't know what to do.\n\n\n\n\n[2nd Update August 18th](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mano_Mama3510/comments/wrik8m/semi_update_niece/)\n\n\n\nI have been bombarded by the most loving and sincere messages and comments and I know I can't get to all of them but I want to thank you fo reaching out. You guys have made me feel from being alone to having an entire community behind me and that is such a reassuring thought. To all those who offered to send Lou gifts and hep out with clothes etc, thank you so much. It's a very touching offer but I do want to let you know that my friends have been spoiling Lou, buying her gifts, taking her out. She's got at least ten stuffed animals alone including one massive life-sized one from me and one from my very sweet neighbor from across the hall. She loves cuddling them both and has named them Boo and Hoo. She thinks its funny as do I when she runs down the hall screaming 'Boo Hoo, lets play'/\n\n\nAnd for those who offered to help me out with my career transition, those who sent me roadmaps and offered to tutor me themselves, or even share their learning accounts with me, God bless you! I will reach out to most of you guys if I run into hiccups but I just started crying when all of you kept reaching out. But I'm planning to do a tech degree from treehouse and do small courses and certifications alongside. But thank you all so much. I've not even gotten to all the messages yet.\n\n\u200b\n\nAbout the Gofundme account I've been asked about, as much as I appreciate the offers, the thing is while I am not crazy rich, I do have some savings and will keep working to increase my income to give Lou a comfortable life. My friends have gathered around me and have given their kids clothes, toys, etc. I've not given Lou everything because I know things are changing for her right now and I want to take it slowly.\n\n\u200b\n\nAlso, my SIL's parents sent me some money yesterday and her mother visited this morning. She didn't say anything but she just stayed for an hour, asked Lou if she was happy and gave me some money. She said she would keep sending money. Lou's maternal grandfather didn't reach out but I suspect his wife might be fond of Lou. She's very sweet and non confrontational. Tbh I've never talked to her before, she's very quiet. But she asked if she could visit again, and I said, only if I was home. She was okay with that.\n\n\nLou's parents haven't reached out but Josh called this afternoon, wanting to talk to Lou. It sounded like he had been crying. I felt bad and I told him he can visit on the weekends as he always done (like I said before, he is always well behaved here). Lou and he talked on the speaker phone for quite a while and he was telling her about the baby rabbits they have or something. I was just keeping an eye on Lou. Lou didn't seem upset when she closed the phone. She's at that age when you really want to get along with your sibling. I would really prefer if I can build a better relationship between the two.\n\n\u200b\n\nThat's all that happened so far. I just wanted to make this post to thank everyone who has and is still reaching out. And I guess I want to reassure you all that things are getting better. From the way, Lou's maternal grandmother was talking, I think she's confident Lou will be staying with me. And I did tell my parents off. I told them that if they want contact with their ONLY granddaughter, they should be grateful she's in a safe environment. I also added that they should be happy that Josh now has his parents full attention. My mom shut up at the first part which makes me suspect that they were aware of other things happening in that house.\n\n\u200b\n\nLastly, I talked to my lawyer who set up an urgent medical examination for Lou. I don't want to get into it but nothing happened to her of any sexual nature. She has bruises here and there which have not faded but aside from the fracture in her arm, there's nothing that suggests anything untoward happening. It's A HUGE relief but Lou was all shaken up by the examination so I took her to get icecream and let her watch two disney movies back to back. She has to go back to school from Monday so I think she'll be fine.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34\ud83d\udd34\n\n\n\n[September 1, '22](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mano_Mama3510/comments/x3b7x4/update_niece/)\n\n\n\nIt's been a minute.\n\n\nSorry for the sudden silence. My inbox has been overflowing and I haven't touched it in a while. Also sorry for the tiny heading which makes no sense.\n\n\nGod, I'm tired.\n\n\nI wanted to give an update considering how many of you reached out and asked and offered help, advice and everything under the sun. All of which I'm very grateful for and probably why I'm writing this post.\n\n\nSo, a lot has happened since my last post. I don't even know where to begin.\n\n\nLou has been removed from my care.\n\n\nI guess I should start from this point.\n\n\nThey took her away four days ago. Social services. She's with my cousin and she's called me crying, multiple times because she wants to come back. I wasn't allowed to accompany her because they think that I might be a danger to her (more on this later). I'm talking to another lawyer, a very good one. He reached out to me on reddit, actually, and it turns out he's a friend of a friend's and was able to deduce who i was from the posts.\n\n\nI was wrong when I thought my brother would back down. And I was an idiot for thinking he would give over Lou so calmly. I'm going to try and follow a timeline. The legal process is being handled but I'm upset and I guess this is a rant post and a self pity one or something.. Because I can;t stop crying.\n\n\n5 days ago - I was home with Lou. She was watching a movie and I was working when the power cut off. We have scheduled hours here when the light is shut off but that wasn't in the schedule. I wasn't worried too much. My laptop was charged and I let her watch the movie on my laptop. I didn't really realize at that point that without the electricity my security cameras don't work. Long and tedious story short, my brother had turned off the breaker. He broke in. I shoved Lou into my room and made her lock the door. He beat me up. I think he would have killed me if my neighbors hadn't heard the commotion. Her father was home and he barged over (my door was open). He got my brother off of me and my neighbor (his daughter) called the police. This is where things got messy. I was bleeding. My face is still bruised and I can't put my weight on my left leg. My brother claimed that I had kidnapped Lou and was sexually abusing her and Josh and he was here to get her back. I had evidence that they had given Lou over willingly and when it came to abuse allegations, it was Lou's word against her brother and parents. Yes, apparently Josh parroted those words. The two policemen who showed up seemed suspicious when Lou kept clinging to me, refusing to go. I don't know how I was functioning in that moment but I managed to call my lawyer who dealt with most of it. I had to be taken to the hospital.\n\n\nIt looks bad but I'm fine-ish. To all those who kept telling me to record conversations etc, thank you. His allegations and my SIL's words about Lou made a weak case. But it was enough for social services to get involved. They removed both Josh and Lou because I started talking. I had evidence, loads of it and I shoved it down their throats. I was still in my apartment at that point. I hadn't left for the hospital. I couldn't. Lou was crying. My lawyer was on his way. If I had gone I was scared they give Lou to my brother.\n\n\n(also when I say social services, its basically an equivalent of some child care organization generally. We don't have social services per say but this is a govt agency)\n\n\nI filed charges against my brother and the SS person was supposed to come day after but I had to go to the hospital. The police accompanied me and let me keep Lou by my side. I don't have any brown bones so I was discharged the next afternoon.\n\n\nI would like to point out that my parents visited and tried to take Lou with them but the policeman who was with me wouldn't let them. I was also protesting.\n\n\nI have to skip stuff here because I'm mentally drained right now. But the gist is that 4 days ago, I got a visit from this lady from SS who said that because of the allegations, they have to remove Lou from my care till the investigation is complete. My cousin stepped up and took her in. My parents took in Josh.\n\n\nThis is ongoing.\n\n\nI don't know why they did this. I'm shaken beyond belief. I'm tired. I can still hear Lou crying in my ears. I don't know why. I wake up terrified at night thinking somebody is in the room. I've been sleeping with the lights on. A friend is sleeping over ever since this whole thing happened. One of my friends got me a small generator for my apartment which I can use to keep the security cameras running and the lights if the electricty is shut off.\n\n\nMy SIL is telling everyone that I ab**** her children. My parents have called me but I've not answered. My lawyer wants me to go in for some evaluation. My brother is in jail because I pressed charges but I heard that my parents are going to post bail.\n\n\nMy life feels like its gone to shit.\n\n\u200b\n\nEDIT: Just want to say that right now I know this post sounds like 'me me me' but I feel like that right now. Lou is upset but she's safe with my cousin, his wife, and kids. She gets along with her cousins so I know she'll be in good hands.\n\n\n\n[September 3, '22](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mano_Mama3510/comments/x4mvsa/update_small_slightly_good/)\n\n\n\nUpdate - Small (slightly good)\nself.Mano_Mama3510\nThis is a small piece of good news. The SS lady came over this morning. She said that based on all the evidence her department has received and the interviews they have conducted from neighbors and teachers, they are confident my brother and SIL's claims are baseless. It's pretty damning evidence. The biggest factor was that they took both Lou and Josh and had a child psychologist evaluate them. They don't show signs of abuse and Josh ended up admitting what his parents had told him to say.\n\n\nBoth kids have now been permanently removed from my brother and SIL's care. SS lady found it disturbing like many of you how SIL referred to Lou and they are considering terminating parental rights. That's what she said. The case is still going to be investigated further but since the accusation was verbal and not a filed report, she says it should be fine. I'm now allowed to visit Lou (supervised) and I'm taking some DIY craft stuff for her and her cousins and will stay over for a night. My cousin has been really supportive throughout which makes me feel better.\n\n\nI spent an hour facetiming Lou and she was happier. I set up a small shop online to sell these digital designs when she first moved in with me and she and I had been spending hours making them together. She's very artsy so I know she enjoyed it. She kept talking about her and her cousins (3 girls, her age group) have been drawing pretty designs and all three of them kept popping onto the screen.\n\n\nIt just showed me that having her there long term might be the best solution. My cousin has mentioned that if things go the way they are going, he and his wife might consider adopting Lou. There;s more to this but while its a good thing, talking about it makes me a little sad so I'm just not for a while. Both he and his wife gave really good reasons which make sense.\n\n\nMy brother lost his job which is something I didn't mention in my last post. Not just because he went to jail but because I blasted both him and SIL on social media, tagging their colleagues. That didn't go over well with my family. My parents showed up and had a lot to say. They didn't so much as ask me how I was doing physically. They kept saying I had destroyed my brothers family because I couldn't leave well enough alone. My lawyer was over at the time and he took great pleasure in kicking them out.\n\n\nSo, yeah, that's where things are standing right now.\n\n\nI have a feeling I might never get Lou back but the family that she is with might be the best option, financially, and emotionally. I did book a meeting with a therapist today. It's going to be next week. A lot of you pointed out that I might be a little traumatized from the break in which is true. So, yeah.\n\u200b\n\nI don't know much about Josh. I know none of this is his fault but a part of me resents him which isn't fair. I haven't reached out to him and I don't want to. My friends are telling me that once this whole thing is sorted, he will need someone by his side and if he stays with my parents, he'll go down the same path as my brother. I think they're suggesting I take him in when the time comes. I don't know. I don't want to. I can't forget how he told the SS that I had s* abused him. (My cousin has refused to take him in).\n\n\nSo, a semi good update and sad. My cousin will come pick me up in a couple of hours. I got some DIY glass paint kits for the girls and some beads and strings for bracelets.\n\n\n\n[September 19, '22](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mano_Mama3510/comments/xix3bo/update_niece_and_nephew/)\n\n\nUpdate - Niece (and Nephew)\n\n\nSo its been a while since my last update and I was pondering over whether to make this or not but I got a lot of requests for one so here goes.\n\n\nMy name is cleared, legally, from every angle. Surprisingly it didn't take that much time.\n\n\nI had a sit down with Josh a few days ago and by that I mean, his school is near my house and I found him in front of my apartment building when I came home from my doctor's appointment last week. I didn't want to be alone with him so I asked my neighbor and her dad to linger about and I called my lawyer. I know I keep turning to him for every sneeze but I didn't know what to do. After the accusations, I simply didn't want to be alone with him.\n\n\nThere was a lot of crying. I get that his entire family unit has been destroyed. He's feeling insecure in a way. He can't see his parents. For some reason, my parents have been blaming him for what happened. That pissed me off. This happened because they did a shitty job of raising their own son. Josh asked if he could stay with. me instead. Now the SS lady who is in charge of this case, wanted to keep Josh and Lou separate for some reason. My lawyer called her to tell her what was happening. She arrived at my apartment within an hour.\n\n\nI have to say you hear shit about these sort of people but this lady is super sweet. She listened to Josh and then to me, privately. I expressed my concerns. However, she said that it might be better to have Josh stay here than my parents. Now that is something that has me uneasy. I told her that and she told me that if I have security cameras inside, I should get them in every room if I am worried. But the child psychologist working with Josh has said he's under too much stress. His school work is suffering. He's not sleeping well. He feels safer here, despite everything.\n\n\nSo now Josh is staying with me.\n\n\nI'm being normal with him but I guess I kind of messed up. When he tries to get a hug or something, I move away. I found him crying day before yesterday about this. I feel like shit for it. I told him to give me time and that I do love him. He's shaken beyond anything and he used to be loud and brash and now he's none of those things. He has circles under his eyes and he's always tired and just quiet.\n\n\nI'm talking to my therapist about it and he told me to let him in bit by bit. And that he faced his own sort of trauma. I've started being more physically affectionate like I used to be and that seems to make him relieved. It's just been a week so I hope he gets better. A lot of you told me to leave him be but when these two kids were born, I was there. I was very involved in their lives.\n\n\nHe's asked about Lou and if he can see her but when I said not yet, he seemed to understand. He drew a card for her but I'm holding on to it for now.\n\n\nHis psychologist says he feels guilty. There's a lot of guilty inside of him and he's not dealing with it well. I took him to the movies today. It was something he;d been waiting for for a while but he just slept through it all.\n\n\nI'm worried but his psychologist tells me to give him time and love.\n\n\nMy parents were pissed by the way. As was my brother and SIL. I got phonecalls from all of them. SIL showed up at my house. I'm considering moving. It's just not safe. My entire family is losing their shit. I have apparently destroyed their reputation, an entire family, and etc.\n\n\nLou is good. Lou is thriving. A two parent household is good for her, like many of you said. She used to call a lot but those calls have lessened over these past two weeks. Which is good for her i guess. She's adjusting. My cousin and his wife adore her. Her cousins like having her there.\n\n\nI started therapy. It's going okay.\n\n\nMy leg is better and my face is looking less like a child went at it with crayons.\n\n\nI still have nightmares. But my focus is on Josh right now so that has me distracted.\n\n\n\n*A note from your reposter:  Seeing some questions in the comments about the timeframe. Remember they aren't in the US. OOP describes their home as a third world country. Also, it doesn't sound like this is a final, official placement. The kids have to be placed somewhere immediately where they are both physically and mentally safe. It doesn't seem odd to me that they had an immediate kinship placement.*",

He works and delivers what needs to be delivered and he showed and proved with Chewy.\n\nAs we could see above, Gamestop is evolving to be a technology company, improving its presence online, improving their brick and mortar stores to not only sell products but sell experience.\n\nOn top of that, Gamestop is working hard in the NFT marketplace ([beta.nft.gamestop.com](https://beta.nft.gamestop.com/)).\n\n**One thing is sure, they DO HAVE A PLAN.

SEC short interest >100% [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qavgl5/biggg\\_gme\\_is\\_the\\_only\\_stock\\_that\\_staff\\_observed/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qavgl5/biggg_gme_is_the_only_stock_that_staff_observed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n3. Short interest is self-reported and if mis-reported, they paid only small fine. For hedge funds it's considered costs to make business.\n4. Short fees are rising (from <1% to +25%)\n\nThere is no evidence that short were closed. Actually there are plenty of evidence that hedge funds are hiding short positions in ETFs and others mechanisms. There is a lot discussed and if you are interested, read the articles in DDs section.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion\n\nSo the quick answer for questions in the title is that MSM is misinforming people because hedges funds shorted GameStop and didn't and can't cover. So it's in their best interest that the Gamestop's shares decrease in price to buy them back.\n\nPeople are buying share and direct registering them which makes shares harder to borrow. Borrow fees went from <1% to +25%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Added conclusion\n\nEDIT2: Thank you u/Conscious_Student_37 to point some english errors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease I don't need any rewards use your money to buy stocks! I'm not looking for karma (I don't even know why do we need karma, I created this account to be able to participate in March when I bought my shares)... Whatever.\n\n**I want people be able to find this article when searching on google, that's all!**",

TL;DR - it didn't go horribly, but it didn't go well either.\n\nPlease note that this thread is no longer being actively maintained.\n\n* Thread Edited 9/13/17 - 2:00 PM EST - Thread is now sorted by \"new\" to make it easier for new questions to be answered. You can manually sort by \"best\" to see additional advice that members of the community have found to be helpful.

The TL;DR of that thread is wait to join a class action and do not sue in small claims court.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n* \"Equifax Inc. said its systems were struck by a cyberattack that may have affected about 143 million U.S. customers of the credit reporting agency...Some U.K. and Canadian residents were also affected.\" [Canadian Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/6yq9gu/equifax_hacked_canadian_consumers_might_be/) and [UK Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/6yvunm/misc_uk_details_in_equifax_data_breach/)\n\n* \"Intruders accessed names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and driver\u2019s license numbers...Credit card numbers for about 209,000 consumers were also accessed.\"\n\n* \"Criminals took advantage of a \"U.S. website application vulnerability to gain access to certain files\" from mid-May through July of this year...The intruders also accessed dispute documents with personal identifying information for about 182,000 consumers.\"\n\n* \"The company set up a website, www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, that consumers can use to determine whether their information was compromised. It\u2019s also offering free credit-file monitoring and identify-theft protection.\"\n\n* The purpose of this sub is not to provide legal advice. However, per https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/frequently-asked-questions/\n\"The arbitration clause and class action wavier included in the TrustedID Premier Terms of Use applies to the free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection products, and not the cybersecurity incident.\"\n\n* **Identity Theft Wiki** - Please see the [identity theft wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft) for steps to take if your identity has been stolen. You may wish to freeze your credit with the different reporting agencies. Note that their websites are currently under a heavy load and may be unresponsive. For more information on what freezing your credit means, see [the FTC's explanation](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0497-credit-freeze-faqs#score)\n\nEquifax also recently [announced](https://twitter.com/Equifax/status/907596989260496896) that they are waiving fees for freezing your credit with them. It is unclear if they plan to offer refunds to those that paid to do so before today.\n\n**Using www.equifaxsecurity2017.com:**\n\n* A helpful discussion adapted from u/likeasomebodie on using www.equifaxsecurity2017.com:\n\n* Check to see if you are effected using [this link](https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/)\n\n* Either of the following messages from Equifax mean your information was stolen:\n\nThank You -- Based on the information provided, we believe that your personal information may have been impacted by this incident...\n\nThank You -- Your enrollment date for TrustedID Premier is: xxxxxx Please be sure to mark your calendar...\n\n* Either of these messages mean that your SSN, DOB, full address, and potentially DL number have been stolen. Assume that information is now public data, because if it's not out there already someone's indexing it right now.\n\n* Please note that some media outliets are reporting that these messages [are not completely reliable](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/psa-no-matter-what-you-write-equifax-may-tell-you-youve-been-impacted-by-the-hack/) However, it still appears that using this site provides at least some information, even if it is not completely accurate.\n\n* See the [identity theft guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft) for additional information on freezing your credit, next steps, etc...\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* Your credit card company may offer some form of identity theft protection/credit monitoring. You should review the benefits that your card has to see if this applies to you.\n\n* Equifax is making credit freezes free for some customers; it isn't clear if this extends to everyone or only certain individuals. UPDATE - it should be free to all - see the [announcement here](https://twitter.com/Equifax/status/907596989260496896). No word on whether previously paid fees will be refunded, but you can call and ask.\n\n* It appears that, in some cases, the PIN you get from Equifax when freezing your credit is just [a time stamp of when the freeze was initiated](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/10/your-money/identity-theft/equifax-breach-credit-freeze.html). If this happened to you, consider requesting a new PIN by mail.\n\n* Some individuals are reporting difficulty obtaining a credit freeze online. You may need to submit documents via mail if this is the case.\n\n* There is now at least 1 [class-action lawsuit](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-08/equifax-sued-over-massive-hack-in-multibillion-dollar-lawsuit) on this issue. Please keep in mind that per Equifax's most recent financials, it has a book value of equity of only about 3 billion dollars on total assets of about 7 billion dollars, so it seems unlikely that 70 billion, even if awarded, could actually be paid.\n\n* u/rholowczak has put together a handy tree of phone options when calling the major credit bureaus [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6yv4gb/official_mega_thread_recent_equifax_security/dmyg4xe/).\n\n**Related Links/Threads On This Issue:**\n\nAuthor | Thread\n---|---\nu/drosophilawing | [Equifax Reports Cyber Incident, May Affect 143 Million U.S. Customers](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6yq36a/equifax_reports_cyber_incident_may_affect_143/)\nu/KlugReeOlympic | [Do not use equifaxsecurity2017.com unless you want to waive your right to participate in a class action lawsuit](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6yryuu/do_not_use_equifaxsecurity2017com_unless_you_want/)\nu/likeasomebodie | [How to tell if you got Equifax'd and what to do about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6ysxxf/how_to_tell_if_you_got_equifaxd_and_what_to_do/)\nu/chocolate_soymilk | [Credit Freeze 101: What they are and how they can help] (https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6yvhiz/credit_freeze_101_what_they_are_and_how_they_can/)\nNY Post | [Cause of Breach](http://nypost.com/2017/09/08/equifax-blames-giant-breach-on-vendor-software-flaw/)\nTelegraph | [Info for U.K.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/09/08/equifax-hack-britons-data-watchdog-investigates-ukimpact-major/)\nTech Crunch | [PSA: no matter what, Equifax may tell you you\u2019ve been impacted by the hack](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/psa-no-matter-what-you-write-equifax-may-tell-you-youve-been-impacted-by-the-hack/)\nBloomberg | [Equifax Faces Multibillion-Dollar Lawsuit Over Hack](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-08/equifax-sued-over-massive-hack-in-multibillion-dollar-lawsuit)\nNew York Times | [After Equifax Breach, Here\u2019s Your Next Worry: Weak PINs](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/10/your-money/identity-theft/equifax-breach-credit-freeze.html)\nCNN | [Equifax hack: What's the worst that can happen?](http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/11/technology/equifax-identity-theft/)\n\n**Administrative Items:**\n\n* All other threads on this topic will be locked to help keep the sub manageable.

        "Body/Content": "Greetings, /r/Pics!\n\nOver the past several days, we've gotten a glimpse of how truly marvelous Reddit can be: Users came together, the media [took notice](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/17/23764729/reddit-users-pics-gifs-subreddits-john-oliver), John Oliver [offered his benevolent support](https://twitter.com/iamjohnoliver/status/1670179738348933120), and Rick Astley [didn\u2019t let us down](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/14cgjq8/john_never_giving_up/)!\n\nNow, granted, things outside of this community might seem bleak. [Reddit\u2019s planned changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/145bram/addressing_the_community_about_changes_to_our_api/) threaten to make the site worse for absolutely everyone, given that bad actors \u2013 spammers, trolls, bigots, propagandists, and worse \u2013 will be tacitly empowered. Moderators (whether they're earnest volunteers or [entities installed by Reddit](https://www.ign.com/articles/reddit-threatens-to-remove-moderators-if-they-dont-reopen-subreddits)) will have a significantly harder time keeping the platform safe and welcoming, and as a result, good-faith users will begin to leave. Their departures will make distasteful content more prominent, and the site will enter a downward spiral. The world watched as Twitter quickly descended, and since [Steve Huffman cites Elon Musk as an inspiration](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/reddit-blackout-protest-private-ceo-elon-musk-huffman-rcna89700), we can assume that Reddit is headed for a similar plunge.\n\nIt isn\u2019t all bad, though!\n\nSure, [there is no reason to trust anything that Reddit might say](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/14dkqrw/i_want_to_debunk_reddits_claims_and_talk_about/), and yes, [statements by Reddit\u2019s CEO](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/) have made it clear that the platform\u2019s users \u2013 be they contributors, moderators, participants, or lurkers \u2013 are [neither valued nor appreciated](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/135tly1/helpdid_reddit_just_destroy_mobile_browser_access/jim40zg/)... but those are just *details*.

Going forward, however, **any and all media featuring John Oliver is allowed in /r/Pics**. Users can now post AI-generated images, videos, erotic fan-fiction, songs, memes, *incredibly* erotic fan-fiction, GIFs, photographs, and fan-fiction that\u2019s erotic enough to make nuns literally explode.\n\nThere are a few caveats:\n\n- If your post happens to be NSFW **in any way**, please mark it as such.\n- Our policies on nudity, gore, and pornography will remain unchanged. (See Rule 2 for details.) \n- Content that violates [the site-wide rules](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) may not be posted.\n- As pictures are no longer the sole focus, \u201c/r/Pics\u201d will become \u201c/r/PICS;\u201d \u201cPosts Illuminating Comedian\u2019s Sexiness.\u201d\n\nFinally, in order to ensure that the community stays on topic, titles must include \u201cJohn Oliver.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, though, have at it! \n\nBask in the glow of John Oliver... and thank you for subscribing to /r/PICS!",

Most science fantasy deals with science fiction tech and space wizards, and while I love me my space wizards, this goes the other way - the technology is powered by magic, the aliens use their own magic that isn\u2019t just Sufficiently Advanced Technology, and the entire story takes place on a single fantasy world that the aliens invaded.\n\n**Length?**\n\n*Dragonflame* clocks in at just about 95k words, which makes it about 300 pages in print.\n\n**Elves and Dwarves?**\n\nNot exactly.

This was not the first horse the guardsman had ridden since leaving the city. The others had perished on the journey. He hadn\u2019t even purchased this horse. Having long ago discarded his tabard and armor, this guardsman wore thick furs to keep out the bitter cold. Between that and the wild look in his eyes, he looked less like a guardsman and more like a bandit. It was fitting, in a way, that the third and final horse he rode was stolen.\n\nHis name was Comber, and he had been part of the troop assigned to protect the royal family against all threats. For ten years he had stood his post, alongside the royal family\u2019s Umbrists. Comber didn\u2019t have the Shadow-infused powers of the Umbrist. He had armor that had been forged with steel mixed with light, and a sword that had been blessed millennia ago with a dragon\u2019s breath.\n\nThat was in the past.\n\nHe had a vow to protect the royal family against any and all threats. He\u2019d fought when the minions of a necromancer had snuck in through the sewers. He still had a scar on his thigh from an assassin\u2019s crossbow bolt meant for the King. He was not a coward, and he had thought himself beyond fear.\n\nThat was also in the past.\n\nComber looked over his shoulder. His pursuers weren\u2019t there. He was alone here. There was nothing but a path through the woods, a path that had been cleared by game hunters who would head this way. It took a bold man to hunt in these woods, given what guarded them. The same being that drew Comber deeper within. His last hope for salvation.\n\nThe skies darkened, and Comber risked a glance upwards. There it was. That hole in the sky. The sun had passed behind it, casting a momentary shadow across the world. It was like the eclipse Comber remembered from when he was a child, but there was still light coming from the center. Small points showing stars unlike any he had seen before.\n\nA few tiny dots broke off from the main circle. Comber shuddered at the sight. He\u2019d seen what those dots could do when they got lower.\n\nThe bundle in his arms stirred when he shivered again, and looked up at him with bright green eyes. Awake now, the child\u2019s face was placid for just a moment, those beautiful eyes flickering about. Then hunger set in, and the child started to wail.\n\n\u201cShhh, little one,\u201d Comber whispered, stroking the side of the child\u2019s face. \u201cShhh.\u201d\n\nStill the child cried. She was just old enough to eat mashed food. Comber grimaced and looked around again. There was no one present. \u201cShhh,\u201d Comber said, pulling on the reins of the horse. He reached into his pack. He still had some berries from the last town, and got to work mashing them into a paste with a mortar and pestle. At her age, the child had just enough understanding of what that smell and sound meant, and her cries turned to excited cooing as she reached towards his hands. \u201cAlmost there, little one,\u201d Comber said. Or at least, he started to say. Halfway through the wound in his side reminded him of why he\u2019d abandoned his sword, and Comber hissed in pain. Even the simple motion of grinding berries was too much for him.\n\nHe set the mortar down carefully. He hadn\u2019t been able to get a spoon in his mad flight. The child was able to suckle the paste off his finger, and that would have to be good enough. Once she\u2019d been fed, Comber held her with one hand and pulled the other inside his coat. He ran his fingers over the hasty bandage. It was damp. He wanted to look at the injury, but didn\u2019t dare. He knew what he\u2019d find. Black veins sprawling outwards from under the bandage, creeping along his skin. Last night, the veins had been halfway to his chest. Soon they would reach his heart.\n\nHe\u2019d die then. Comber didn\u2019t need to be a Physician to know that.\n\nThe child reached up and grabbed for his nose with hands wrapped in mittens. Comber let her grab it, then pressed his forehead to hers. \u201cSoon, you\u2019ll be safe,\u201d Comber whispered to her.\n\nThen it was time to transition the child to the straps wrapped around his chest, freeing his hands, and Comber resumed his ride to the mountain.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe horse - Comber had never bothered giving it a name - came to a stop, and the jolt rocked Comber awake. He blinked around blearily. He\u2019d fallen asleep in the saddle somehow. Everything felt like it had been coated in a layer of wool. Comber worked one of his hands free of the glove and pressed it against his forehead. In spite of the cold, heat radiated from the touch. \u201cFever,\u201d he muttered to the child.\n\n\u201cBah-bah-bah-bah,\u201d she said, which Comber took as affirmation. He smiled down at her, then looked around again. They\u2019d reached the mountain.\n\n\u201cWe go no further together,\u201d he said to the horse. Comber had never been one to speak to his mounts, aside from commands. He preferred to make noises at them, reassuring ones. But in the grip of fever, Comber felt irrationally sorry for abandoning an animal he\u2019d only had for a day. A stolen one, at that. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to find your way back to town, won\u2019t you? Or maybe you\u2019ll be able to run free now, without the need...the need\u2026\u201d Comber trailed off. What had he been doing? Talking to a horse, that\u2019s what.\n\nThey were close to the base of the mountain, but not quite there. He could see it. Perhaps he could ride the horse a little bit further? He dug his heels in. The horse let out a huff of air and shook its head, instead backing up a few paces. \u201cOf course,\u201d Comber said, shaking his head. \u201cOf course. A horse. A horse of course.\u201d He laughed a bit. It wasn\u2019t funny, but the child joined in the laughter. He patted the side of the horse\u2019s neck again. \u201cYou smell it, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nThe horse shook its head violently and took another step back. That was all the confirmation Comber needed. The horse would go no further. \u201cYou know,\u201d Comber said, getting ready to dismount. \u201cI should have known. They eat you, don\u2019t they?\u201d\n\nThe horse did not respond this time, for it was a horse, and all it cared about was that it didn\u2019t need to go any further.\n\nComber got one foot out of the stirrup, but the world started to spin. Instead of dismounting gracefully, Comber swung drunkenly, and collapsed into the snow. He had just enough presence of mind to turn around as he fell, landing on his back to keep the child safe. Comber growled in pain as the impact lanced through his back. The shock did wonders for clearing his head. The child, jostled by the fall, poked her head up and giggled.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Comber grunted. \u201cI\u2019m silly, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nThe child reached up for him, grasping for him. Comber put his finger out for her to hold onto.\n\nHe\u2019d abandoned his station, and he knew he should feel guilty about that, but\u2026the beings that had come from that hole in the sky were beyond anything that could be fought. Arrows bounced off their gleaming carapace. Swords were deflected with swipes from their unnatural hands. He had a duty, and he could only save one person.\n\nHe\u2019d chosen her.\n\nComber rose to his feet and turned the horse around. It only took a nudge to get the horse trotting away from the mountain.\n\nIt would live. The child would live. That would have to be enough.\n\nComber made himself walk towards the mountain. Every footstep was like lead. He spotted a trail in the snow - someone else had come this way and left. They were human, or at least walked like one. It could be an Underfolk or Sylvani. It wasn\u2019t the invaders. That much was certain. No one could mistake their skittering legs for human footsteps.\n\nThe mountain, at least, was free of snow. Impossibly free, and impossibly warm. A fire burned in the heart of this mountain. Not the molten fire of a volcano. A living flame. A hungering flame.\n\nHad the fever started sooner than Comber realized? He\u2019d been so certain of this plan. He\u2019d heard tales of the flame that lived in this mountain. The tales had made it out to be one of the ones that did not feast on the flesh of Man or the other Intelligent Races. They said it had stood alongside the forces of the Light and Shadow against dread powers in the past. They said it was not to be disturbed, but would not slay - except for those that came to attack it.\n\nBut still...could he trust it?\n\nIt was too late now. There was nowhere else he was certain would be safe for the child. Not with that locket, secured carefully in a pouch in the swaddling. Even without it...would anywhere be safe from the invaders? Would anything? They hadn\u2019t been killing innocents. They\u2019d killed armies, they\u2019d slaughtered guards, but any who did not pick up blade or spear against them was spared their wrath. Yet...Comber didn\u2019t trust them to stop there. It was possible - nay, it seemed likely - that they were just starting with those that posed a threat to them.\n\n\u201cNot that we did,\u201d he said to the child, who paused in her attempts to gum his finger to look up at him. \u201cI hope, if you remember nothing else, you remember that we tried. We tried.\u201d\n\n\u201cBurrrbl,\u201d the child said happily.\n\n\u201cWe tried,\u201d Comber repeated. And they had. Nicandros, the captain of the royal guard, had commanded them perfectly. However, no strategy could overcome the fact that their weapons did no harm to the invaders. That was when Comber realized the only option was saving what he could. That there would be no victory here. Still, Comber had fought, until his wound. Then...he\u2019d been even more useless in battle.\n\nTime became unstable. Comber kept walking up the warm mountain and its bare stones. It was a gentle slope, which was the only reason he could progress at all. Ahead, he saw his goal.\n\nA hole, high up the mountain. One far larger than would be needed for a man to pass through, and one too smooth and round to be the result of nature. This was not a cave. It was a lair.\n\nComber stumbled and dropped to his knees. The child started to wail again, startled by the jostling. Comber tried to shush its cries, but he was too late. Something was stirring in the lair, dragging itself forth from the depths. Comber saw golden eyes peering out of the darkness, followed by red scales and immense, bat-like wings.\n\nComber had never seen a dragon in person. Only flying overhead, and even then, such sights were rare. He\u2019d expected them to crawl across a ground, like a lizard, but this one slunk with a cat\u2019s grace. An older cat, one that was past its prime hunting days, but still possessing enough energy to move about. The dragon flapped its wings and took to the air, circling around Comber once before landing.\n\n\u201cI told Lathariel I would not be disturbed,\u201d the dragon growled, and Comber was certain he\u2019d made a mistake. Tears started to form in his eyes, unbidden.\n\n\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d Comber said, but the dragon shook its head.\n\n\u201cI will not fight.\u201d The dragon looked up, seeing the hole in the sky, and its nostrils flared. For a moment, Comber could see it considering...then it shook its head again. \u201cI will not fight,\u201d it repeated. \u201cLeave this threat for younger drakes. Ones that have hotter flames.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d Comber said again, then coughed. Flecks of something black came with the cough, and Comber moved with speed he didn\u2019t know he still had, pulling the child free of the path of whatever those were. He groaned in pain and nearly blacked out.\n\n\u201cYou are injured,\u201d the dragon said, leaning down. \u201cAnd you are ill.\u201d\n\nComber nodded.\n\n\u201cI can heal your injuries,\u201d the dragon said, after considering for a moment. \u201cBut my flames will make the disease spread quicker.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot...me.\u201d Comber coughed again. \u201cHer.\u201d\n\nThe dragon looked at the child. \u201cShe\u2019s uninjured,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCare...protect.\u201d Comber\u2019s vision grew dark. \u201cShe...she...is.\u201d Comber\u2019s vision narrowed. \u201cShe is...everything....\u201d The dragon was barely visible now. The world was barely visible. The child stirred, looking from the dragon to Comber and back again, starting to make distressed noises. She didn\u2019t fear the dragon. That was good. But she could tell something was wrong.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Comber said to the child. He looked back up at the dragon. His vision was barely there anymore. He\u2019d gone so far. It felt like part of his mind had been set on fire, to hold back death, and now that he was here, that flame had gone out. \u201cTell her\u2026\u201d Comber said, and then he started to cough again. \u201cShe is\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat should I tell her she is?\u201d the dragon asked, after Comber had been silent for too long. When he got no response, the dragon Karjon leaned down. The man\u2019s heartbeat had been so faint when he\u2019d approached, Karjon could barely hear it. Now, though? Now there was nothing.\n\nAnd the child started to cry.\n\nKarjon looked at it. He\u2019d never dealt with human children before. He knew they needed more comfort than hatchlings. Uncertain, Karjon reached out with one claw and retracted his talon, then brushed his scales on the child\u2019s cheek.\n\nQuick as a viper, the child grabbed Karjon\u2019s finger tightly, trying to seek some comfort in a world that had abandoned her.\n\nKarjon sighed. He had not had children of his own. He hadn\u2019t planned on doing so. But...if nothing else, he could not leave this child to starve on his mountain. He carefully bit on the swaddling, making certain to only let his fangs touch the fabric.\n\nOnce these invaders had been dealt with, Karjon would take the child to the nearest humans. They would know how to handle her. He\u2019d keep her safe until then. It shouldn\u2019t be long. There had been many threats over his nine hundred years of life. They\u2019d always been defeated.\n\nThere was no reason to believe this would be any different.\n\n# Chapter 1\n\n\u201cI have lived for centuries,\u201d Karjon growled. \u201cI dueled the Necromancer Gix and his army of undead. I was on the Council of Twelve, battling the Lichborne. When the mad Lumcaster sought to blind the world, I doused him in my flames. How is it that nothing has vexed me as much as you, little one?\u201d\n\nTythel looked up at the dragon with eyes wide in feigned innocence. Sixteen years had passed since the mountain and the snow. She didn\u2019t remember it, of course. Just as she did not remember what her name had been before coming here. Tythel was a dragon\u2019s name, not a human name. For all Karjon\u2019s bluster, she was not worried. In sixteen years, Karjon had never raised a claw in anger. \u201cFather, have you considered that it is just because you love me so dearly?\u201d\n\nKarjon huffed and shook his head. \u201cThat cannot be it. I think it *must* be because I did not know how *vexing* your unique subspecies of humans can be.\u201d\n\n\u201cSubspecies?\u201d Tythel asked.\n\n\u201cYes. Those strange beings humans call \u2018adolescents.\u2019 Or perhaps it is just a trait unique to daughters.\u201d\n\nTythel beamed at him. The expression only came through with her eyes. In her books, humans would use their mouths to do things like smile and frown. Tythel understood, in theory, what those were, but the expressions didn\u2019t come to her naturally. From what Karjon had said, she\u2019d smiled and frowned at first...but with time, those had stopped. Now, she blinked rapidly to show her excitement. \u201cWhich would only matter because you love me. Therefore, I am still correct. And, since I *am* correct, I see no reason I should not be allowed to go.\u201d\n\nKarjon sighed heavily. \u201cTythel\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said I could,\u201d Tythel reminded him, trying her best not to sound sullen.\n\n\u201cI told you that, yes,\u201d Karjon said. \u201cI said you could go when it was safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to see other humans,\u201d Tythel said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I go?\u201d\n\nKarjon sighed again, a sound that filled the entire cave that was his lair and their home. \u201cWhen, exactly, did \u2018because I said so\u2019 become insufficient?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I stopped being a child,\u201d Tythel said. \u201cYou said when I was sixteen, I could go and see other humans.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said that you could go into the village when you were sixteen, Tythel. I did not say you could do so the very next day.\u201d Making that promise, back when she was nine, had been a mistake. He\u2019d done it to get her to cease her incessant questions. He didn\u2019t think humans of that age could *remember* things for so long.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re splitting scales and you know it.\u201d She folded her arms across her chest and glowered at him.\n\nKarjon, who weighed in at just over six tons and had battled some of the greatest foes the world had ever seen, broke the staring contest first. Tythel tried not to blink when she realized that meant she was getting through to him. For all his fury and might, Karjon had always struggled to deny her anything. Still, he was not caving like he usually did. \u201cTythel, there are reasons for the choices I make. They are for your safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always hide behind that, father. Are you planning on keeping me here the rest of my life? What are you hiding me *from?*\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are those out there that would see you dead. Is that not enough explanation?\u201d\n\nShe glowered at him again. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t do anything if you don\u2019t tell me. But if you want me to leave it alone, you\u2019ll need to give me more than that.\u201d Her expression softened. \u201cPlease, father.\u201d\n\nKarjon settled down onto the pile of coins that made his seat. Tythel took the cue and walked over to her own, smaller pile. She didn\u2019t have a hoard of her own. Not yet. But she would one day, although she was less than eager for that day. Dragons did not share a hoard. She\u2019d have to leave that day, never to live here again.\n\n\u201cPerhaps\u2026\u201d Karjon started to say, then held up a claw to forestall her before she got too excited. \u201cIt is time you know of the dangers beyond this lair. Why I keep you hidden here. And tomorrow\u2026\u201d he studied her critically for a moment, then nodded. \u201cYou are old enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo go visit?\u201d Tythel asked hopefully.\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Karjon said, shaking his head. \u201cBut tomorrow, I think you are ready for the one thing I know you want more than to leave.\u201d\n\nTythel sat up straighter, her eyes sparkling with excitement. \u201cYou mean...you\u2019ll finish the adoption?\u201d\n\nKarjon nodded, and Tythel leapt up to run over and wrap her arms around her father\u2019s neck. \u201cThank you thank you thank you!\u201d There were tears forming in her eyes, a human reaction she hadn\u2019t shed with age, but these were tears of joy and not sadness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s past time,\u201d Karjon said. \u201cI just worried about how your body would react to the transformation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Tythel said, although deep in her heart, she\u2019d worried that he wouldn\u2019t do it. That she wasn\u2019t good enough. She\u2019d never told Karjon that. If it wasn\u2019t true, it would have broken his heart. If it was true...she couldn\u2019t have handled that. Now, though, she was practically vibrating with anticipation.\n\nKarjon put one of his claws around her, in his version of a hug. From what he\u2019d said, dragons did not engage in touch the way humans did, but one of his books had told him a lack of touch and affection could kill human infants. Deep down, Tythel suspected he had grown to like it himself. \u201cNow. Will you listen, and will you wait?\u201d\n\nTythel nodded firmly.\n\n\u201cThen do so,\u201d Karjon said, and Tythel settled back onto her coins. \u201cSixteen years ago, just days before you were brought to me...the skies let loose monsters.\u201d\n\n\u201cMonsters?\u201d Tythel asked.\n\nKarjon nodded. \u201cI do not know if they have a name. I know what Lathariel told me they were being called \u2018Those From Above.\u2019 They had weapons that sucked in light and spewed forth their own unnatural energy. Unlight, she called it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you fought them?\u201d Tythel asked, excitedly.\n\nKarjon shook his head, and in his eyes Tythel could see sorrow she\u2019d never imagined from her father. \u201cI am old,\u201d Karjon said. \u201cI thought they could be defeated without me. Even when I was told dragonflame was all that would harm them...I still thought they could be defeated. There were other dragons. By the time I realized...it was too late. Those From Above had secured power over humanity. They rule down there now. As far as I know, they only fear dragonflame.\u201d\n\nTythel held up a hand and focused. A ball of flame formed between her fingers. \u201cThey fear this?\u201d she asked. Dragonflame was similar to normal fire, but more vibrant. The transition from white to yellow to orange to red that happened in a normal flame was marked by clearer lines. Hers was weak. Not close to the true power of a dragon. She could barely call upon it, and couldn\u2019t even touch the greater fires of ghostflame or heartflame. But it was not nothing.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Karjon said, and there was a somber note to his voice that Tythel couldn\u2019t ignore. \u201cBy healing you when you injured yourself...you already formed the gift.  They will hunt you. For that and...for other reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat other reasons?\u201d\n\nKarjon shook his head. \u201cNot yet. There is much I have kept from you. You are old enough now, but...before that there\u2019s something you need to understand.\u201d He put one claw carefully on her knee. \u201cTythel...tomorrow, after the Ascension, the number of dragons in the world will go from one to two.\u201d\n\nTythel stared at her father for a long moment, processing his words. She\u2019d never met another dragon, but the idea there had been other dragons out there...she\u2019d just assumed it. Realizing they\u2019d been hunted down, there was only one thing to do.\n\nShe hugged Karjon again, and her father hugged her back. They sat there for a moment, before both of them could steady themselves enough to speak. \u201cTythel,\u201d Karjon said. \u201cI\u2026have kept something else from you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much,\u201d Tythel whispered.\n\nKarjon cocked his head. \u201cDo you need time before the rest?\u201d\n\nTythel considered for a moment, then shook her head. \u201cA scholar\u2019s first duty is to acquire all information before passing judgement,\u201d Tythel said, repeating one of her father\u2019s lessons back to him.\n\nKarjon gave her a slow blink of amusement. \u201cYou listen too well sometimes. Very well. Your locket.\u201d\n\nTythel\u2019s hands went up to the chain around her neck. She\u2019d worn it as long as she could remember. It was the one piece of her own hoard she had.  \u201cYou said it was my parents.\u201d\n\nKarjon nodded. \u201cThat locket is the other reason you will be hunted. It is the locket of the royal family.\u201d\n\nThere was a moment of silence as Tythel stared at her father. \u201cThe\u2026the royal family. But they\u2026I mean\u2026that\u2019s\u2026\u201d Tythel sputtered off into silence. She couldn\u2019t say it. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026\u201d\n\nKarjon nodded, the motion oddly gentle. \u201cYou are the heir to the throne of your family. The throne of the kingdom of Dretayne. You are the next queen of this realm. And for that, you will be hunted as one of the barriers to the rule of Those from Above.\u201d\n\nTythel took a deep, ragged breath, then nodded slowly. She couldn\u2019t think about it right now. She could barely understand it. So she fell back on the lessons of her childhood. A scholar's first duty. \u201cTell me everything.\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nTythel did not sleep well that night. She tried to, doing every meditation technique Karjon had taught her over the years, but she spent the entire night tossing and turning. The bed she slept on was one Karjon had gotten as a trophy from the Underfolk, those strange underground folk that were in Karjon\u2019s stories, and it had been perfect for her when she was a child. But for the last two years, she\u2019d been forced to scrunch up on it, leading to the impression the Underfolk were likely quite small.\n\nIn truth, Tythel was taller than most humans. Sixteen years of eating a diet of meat cooked in dragonflame and lifting and moving gold on a regular basis had left her with a build that was less princess and more warrior, but since the only humans she\u2019d seen had been in her imagination, she\u2019d had no idea how imposing a figure she could cut when she wasn\u2019t comparing herself to a dragon.\n\nShe\u2019d never complained to Karjon about the small bed. Other things, sure, but never that \u2013 or any of the other things he\u2019d provided to her over the years. Tythel had known how lucky she\u2019d been to have a dragon for a father. Karjon\u2019s stories were full of tales of the legendary heroes of the past, Calcon the Brave and Rilan the Just and Brigith the Nobel and all the rest of them. All of them had started their lives as humble folk that had heeded the Call, which meant their lives had been the humdrum work of farmers and blacksmiths and other folk, and the stories all made that life out to be terribly dull.\n\nShe\u2019d always imagined Karjon had rescued her from that sort of suffering.\n\nNow she knew differently. She would have been a princess, daughter to a king and queen, living a life of luxury and wealth and, if the legends were any indication, would have either ended up spoiled rotten or kidnapped by someone to later be rescued. Other than that her life would have been one of formality and circumstance until she was married off to secure an alliance or to whoever had been strong enough to save her, regardless of their other qualities.\n\nTythel decided that, small bed aside, she still felt lucky to have been raised by Karjon. That feeling was quickly followed by shame at even considering an alternative.\n\nShe got out of bed and pulled her blankets and pillows to the floor, arranging them in a pile like the gold Karjon slept on. It wasn\u2019t as comfortable as the bed, but it did allow her to stretch out, and that was preferable to being cramped into the bed at the moment.\n\nThe problem was, it wasn\u2019t the bed keeping her up tonight. It was her mind.\n\nTythel had been on top of the mountain a few times every year, under Karjon\u2019s careful eye. He had explained that if she didn\u2019t get to see the sky every now and then, she\u2019d probably go mad. The village had always fascinated her, and her entire life she\u2019d wanted to go there, just for a day, to explore and celebrate. She wanted to see horses and soldiers and blacksmiths and maybe even a lumcaster if she was really lucky. Karjon had taught her some magic, the barest flicker of dragonflame, but it was not magic meant for humans.\n\nOf course, that would change tomorrow. Well, her being human \u2013 she didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d gain any proficiency with her meager powers in the process. She\u2019d have Karjon\u2019s power running through her veins, becoming half dragon and half human. For most of her life, it had been the one thing she\u2019d wanted more than going to the village.\n\n*The village.* She turned over again.\n\nFrom the mountain, it had been hard to make out details. She\u2019d filled in those details in her head with ones stolen from her stories \u2013 thatched roofs covering star-crossed lovers, barns harboring hard working folk with wisdom gained from years of honest toil, scholars in cramped quarters trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, chimneys smoking with fires that were roasting chickens or beef. Never in her life had she imagined the people out there were being subjected to tyrants that had more power than she could imagine. Never, not once, had she imagined that she was their ruler by a mere quirk of birth.\n\nThat thought got her turning again. Karjon\u2019s stories had talked about something called \u201cnoblesse oblige,\u201d the responsibilities that the nobility had to their people. Protect them, help them, guide them, and care for them. If she was a noble \u2013 a royal \u2013 didn\u2019t the same thing apply to her?\n\n*Stop it, Tythel. Stop it.*\n\nBut the thought wouldn\u2019t go away. If she stayed here with Karjon, she was failing in her responsibility. The sixteen years leading up to this had not been her fault; she hadn\u2019t known she had duties. After a moment of reflection, she decided they weren\u2019t Karjon\u2019s fault either. They were the fault of the mysterious Those from Above. Now that she knew, however\u2026well, Karjon had always taught her that inaction was still a choice, the choice to do nothing.\n\nTomorrow, then, after the Ritual. She\u2019d leave, no matter what. And if Karjon tried to stop her\u2026well, then she\u2019d have to do it alone.\n\nAnd that thought, more than any other, caused Tythel to burrow as deeply as she could into the blankets before sleep finally claimed her.\n\n\\---\n\nWant to know what happens next?

[Check it out here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/vp01of/drscomputershare_megathread_072022/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's start with a TLDR, *straight from* ***GameStop***:\n\n**On July 6, 2022, GameStop Corp. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) issued a press release announcing that its Board of Directors had approved and declared a four-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend. Each Company stockholder of record at the close of business on July 18, 2022 will receive three additional shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock for each then-held share of Class A common stock, to be distributed after the close of trading on July 21, 2022.**\n\n[GameStop Announces Four-for-One Stock Split | Gamestop Corp.

In the Stock dividend, additional shares are given to shareholders whereas in stock split, already issued shares are split in an agreed ratio. No additional shares are allotted.\n\nIn fact, the dividend aspect of the split only affects the company's accounting -- basically how much it keeps in its retained earnings account -- and not much else. By declaring it a stock dividend, GameStop's cash balances won't be affected by it as they would be with a cash dividend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ccxaqixl9a91.jpg?width=955&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e75d76f0412951206aa7ec77836d4a47fe7c3f01\n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.educba.com/stock-dividend-vs-stock-split/](https://www.educba.com/stock-dividend-vs-stock-split/)\n\n[https://www.principlesofaccounting.com/chapter-14/splits-and-dividends/](https://www.principlesofaccounting.com/chapter-14/splits-and-dividends/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What does this all mean?**\n\nGamestop has announced they will be doing a stock dividend. After the dividend, there will be four shares for every one pre-dividend share. (So it is called a \u201c4-for-1 split.\u201d) In other words, if you have one share, you will get 3 additional ones.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 share will now equal 4 shares](https://preview.redd.it/9bikz1y1m9a91.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5fb54b62f361d57a9a371935ac406ae3e5a9f96)\n\n**What will happen to the share price?**\n\nIf the stock was at $135 per share, after the split, each share will be $33.75, because the company\u2019s net assets didn\u2019t increase, only the number of outstanding shares.\n\nIf you own $1,000 worth of GME on the 21st you will still own $1,000 worth of GME on the 22nd.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ib7woqm6m9a91.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bfc573a2d5cc1415c4e379a45c7d19d75b5d670\n\n[Credit: u\\/jmastajay](https://preview.redd.it/igbc3w0am9a91.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&s=377de75c27c330f51b31eb2d975b48db59c3389f)\n\n**What do you have to do?**\n\nNothing! You can BUY & HODL, DRS, the usual. When a stock split or stock dividend occurs, your account will receive the additional shares on the ex-dividend date. The cost basis and gain/loss information for the shares will be updated on the evening of the ex-dividend date. No action is required for shareholders to receive shares as part of the event.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**When do I need to buy to receive the dividend? (Brokers)**\n\nYou can buy stock any time. Stock dividends work differently than cash dividends. For stock dividends, the record date doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nThe ex-date or ex-dividend date is the trading date on (and after) which the dividend is not owed to a new buyer of the stock.\n\nJuly 21st is the date on which GME will actually distribute the three additional shares in its stock dividend. That happens officially after the stock market closes, so any trades that occur earlier that day are still governed by the pre-split stock price.\n\nEx-Dividend Date is July 22nd.\n\n*\"Sometimes a company pays a dividend in the form of stock rather than cash. The stock dividend may be additional shares in the company or in a subsidiary being spun off. The procedures for stock dividends may be different from cash dividends.* ***The ex-dividend date is set the first business day after the stock dividend is paid (and is also after the record date).***\n\n***If you sell your stock before the ex-dividend date, you also are selling away your right to the stock dividend. Your sale includes an obligation to deliver any shares acquired as a result of the dividend to the buyer of your shares, since the seller will receive an I.O.U. or \"due bill\" from his or her broker for the additional shares.*** *Thus, it is important to remember that the day you can sell your shares without being obligated to deliver the additional shares is\u00a0not\u00a0the first business day after the record date, but usually is the first business day after the stock dividend is paid.\"*\n\nSource: [Ex-Dividend Dates: When Are You Entitled to Stock and Cash Dividends | Investor.gov](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/ex-dividend-dates-when-are-you-entitled-stock-and)\n\nYou can buy any time because the exchanges have splits covered \u2013 there is absolutely no danger of an investor missing out on the split shares, no matter when he or she buys shares that will split.\n\nThis explains the Tesla split really well:\n\nRegarding the Tesla split (dates are referring to Tesla's split): *\" However, stock dividends often have different rules. Here, the ex-dividend date is one business day after the dividend actually gets paid. Therefore, the record date doesn't really matter. If you buy stock on or before Aug. 28, then you're also buying the right to receive the extra stock in the split. If you sell before that date, you're selling away those rights as well.\"*\n\n[Tesla's Stock Split: Here's What It'll Look Like When It Happens](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/26/teslas-stock-split-heres-what-itll-look-like/)\n\n**Disclaimer:** It is possible that due to broker back-office mechanics, shares purchased after 7/18 with a 'due bill' for the additional shares may not appear by 7/22, however anyone purchasing from 7/18-7/21 is still entitled to the dividend of additional shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**When do I need to buy to receive the dividend? (Computershare)**\n\nIf you have an existing account, you are already on record. If you are buying directly from Computershare, the last day you could buy to receive the dividend of the additional shares would be 7/18 for the buy to execute by 7/21. It takes 3 days after initiating your buy order for your cash to settle before they can execute the buy order.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about transfers?**\n\nThis will vary by brokerage, and you should contact your individual brokerage to find out.\n\nFidelity Agents have stated you can transfer shares until the 18th, and then again on the 22nd.\n\nIf you have shares in transit on the way to Computershare, if Computershare receives them by the 21st, the dividend shares will show up in Computershare. Otherwise, the shares will show up in your old broker since that's where you'd still be on record as owning shares. Your broker is then required to transfer to your new account within 10 business days of receiving the dividend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about the shorts?**\n\nThe same math works for them. If someone spends $1,000 shorting GME they will still be short $1,000 worth of GME on market open.\n\nWhile shorts would be required to pay a cash dividend, a stock dividend works pretty much the same for all investors regardless of whether you're short or long.\n\nBasically, they will not be required to purchase anything unless they need to close due to other circumstances, such as the price going up too fast, cost to borrow being too expensive, margin calls etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Let's check in with the shorts (that we know of):**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u3rxwoedm9a91.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&s=27304100094379a9fa88fd0bbeb88e7db8fc69e8\n\n[Fintel: Shares Available](https://preview.redd.it/2i7vhx5hm9a91.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=6654718078830ccf0f0dc12319d3daa24ef643df)\n\n[Fintel: Cost to Borrow](https://preview.redd.it/jvfbh87km9a91.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fb2c96a830cd70eb1eb6c2d7085094b95a5035e)\n\n[Since 5\\/24\\/22, Fidelity has had 0 shares available](https://preview.redd.it/e7q6hpinm9a91.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4d7788231556f8db41ff7ab32316639ef3f0616)\n\n[Record Breaking Short Utilization](https://preview.redd.it/ae1owo7qm9a91.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=20383c2c020d7dc6c27029b7359f660417545f0d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Is this game over for the shorts?**\n\nFirst, **let\u2019s elaborate on the points above and clear up some misinformation** that\u2019s been spreading.\n\nThe information below **ONLY applies to** **CASH** **dividends:**\n\n*Investors short a stock are never entitled to its dividends, and that includes those short a stock on its dividend record date. Rather, short sellers owe any declared dividend payments to the shares' lenders.*\n\nShorts **do not owe** declared dividend payments to the shares\u2019 lenders for dividend stock splits. Payment refers to cash dividends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What about the shares on loan?**\n\nShares can be recalled by lenders at any time for any reason, but they can continue borrowing as long as lenders are lending.\n\nCash dividends get paid by the borrower to the lender on the dividend payment date.\n\nSource to rules:   [National Securities Clearing Corporation - Rules & Procedures](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rules/nscc_rules.pdf) (Pg 109 begins with The CNS System - Pg 112, Section 8(b) explains the process with stock dividends)\n\nNon-cash distributions like a stock dividend just get added to the loan balance and are not immediately paid to the lender. The borrower only has to return the additional shares when they close out the loan, either when the lender recalls the loan or the short seller closes their position.\n\nSource: Standard Lending Agreement\n\nCopy of the MSLA: [https://www.sifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/MSLA\\_Master-Securities-Loan-Agreement-2017-Version.pdf](https://www.sifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/MSLA_Master-Securities-Loan-Agreement-2017-Version.pdf) (Per paragraph 8.2, cash and non-cash dividends are handled differently.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Back to how this hurts the shorts:**\n\n***\"Not accepting that stock splits add value is a recipe for losing money.\"*** Historically, stock splits have impacted shareholder sentiment and have fostered short-term rallies. This has been seen with several tech giants, including Tesla, Amazon, NVIDIA, and Apple.\n\n**In the specific case of GameStop, the stock split should be a potential short-term catalyst for increased buying volume. In turn, this will pressure short sellers to cover their margins.**\n\nSource: [GameStop Stock: What You Need to Know About the 4-for-1 Split](https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/gme/gamestop-stock-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-4-for-1-split)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**More reasons why this is good for GME holders:**\n\nStock splits can improve trading liquidity and make the stock seem more affordable.\n\nIn a stock split the number of outstanding shares increases and the price per share decreases proportionally, while the market capitalization and the value of the company do not change.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how Apple shareholders benefited when this was done in 2020:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[March 30th, 2022](https://preview.redd.it/d70i4ka2n9a91.png?width=926&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0e44ea084c76081c679c5f76b5e816c838793d8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Has this been done before?**\n\nAnother recent example of what happens with a stock split dividend is Tesla, back when 10% short interest was *high*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nxaha7hym9a91.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=99a0e97918a9093c52ae77874cd3f9414a6b3d76\n\nThe above picture depicts Tesla\u2019s post-split performance. As is evident, the stock clocked in gains of over 300 percent between the announcement of a stock split and the receipt of additional shares, with the stock rising from $350 to $2,210. After undergoing this 5-to-1 split, the stock price was adjusted to $442. However, Tesla shares maintained their upward trajectory even after the consummation of this move, with the stock recording an all-time high of $1,243.49 in November 2021, equating to $6,217 in pre-stock split price terms. This entire journey consists of gains of 1,776.11 percent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredit to u/Cataclysmic98 for their post going through this:\n\n[A comparative look at Tesla's stock split.

Unless the stock is sold, you would not report the stock dividend on your tax return.\n\nSource: [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p550.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p550.pdf) (page 21)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What happens to the DRSbot share count?**\n\n**TLDR:** u/Roid_Rage_Smurf has a plan. Check out his post with the details here:\n\n[**DRSBOT splividivisplividend and stuff...** ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/vtonvj/drsbot_splividivisplividend_and_stuff/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What\u2019s going on with Fidelity not allowing DRS?**\n\nThere were reported issues of Fidelity no longer allowing transfers to Computershare until after the split. This was a temporary issue and is now resolved. You are still able to transfer from Fidelity to Computershare until 7/18. If you are told you cannot do this before 7/18, **ask to speak to a corporate compliance officer.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Do I need to adjust any settings with my broker to receive the dividend?**\n\nThis only applies if the dividends are cash. If the dividends were cash, you could choose cash equivalent or you can choose to reinvest in the stock - meaning when the cash came, it would default to purchasing. Since this dividend is in the form of additional shares, you will receive those additional shares regardless of settings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Will DRS shares have priority to receive the dividend first?**\n\nPotentially, since Computershare is the transfer agent responsible for distributing the stock dividends. However, when this will be reflected in accounts is still to be determined, so we can't say 'yes' for sure.\n\nDifferent brokerage companies have their own procedures for handling their accounting records for stock splits. Even though the additional shares are to be distributed after market close on 7/21, you may not see them reflected in your account then. It is reasonable to expect that by 7/22, your account will be credited with the correct number of post-split shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Do fractional shares receive dividends?**\n\nPotentially, this is up to the issuer.\n\nSources:\n\n[Do Fractional Shares Pay Dividends?](https://thepoorinvestor.eu/fractional-shares-dividends/)\n\n[How Do Fractional Shares Work?](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-do-fractional-shares-work-2020-09-09)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# MORE HYPE!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Marketplace is launching any day now!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Credit: u\\/Peter\\_Rodrigues1986](https://preview.redd.it/jhawsbe8n9a91.png?width=867&format=png&auto=webp&s=b765176c6181d80384b95d463ab7a41e508f1c20)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Catch up here!**\n\n[GameStop NFT Marketplace & Wallet Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/vluysg/gamestop_nft_marketplace_wallet_megathread/) (Credit to u/bah2o)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How could the stock dividend tie to the marketplace launch?**\n\nCheck out this speculation post from u/knutolee\n\n[GameStop timed the 4-to-1 stock dividend perfectly with the launch of the NFT marketplace to deliver a reason for the imminent stock jump](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/vtatsr/gamestop_timed_the_4to1_stock_dividend_perfectly/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What Happens Next?\n\n**All of the information provided within this post is based on fair market conditions.

        "Title": "GameStop cannot enact a Share Recall. But I found evidence (and an amazing precedent) they can instead direct a mandatory Share Surrender. That really could lead to forced closing of short positions, and thereby trigger MOASS.",
        "Body/Content": "# 0. Preface\n\n**TLDR:** For the last 84 years, there has been hope on this sub that GameStop does a Share Recall and forces SHFs to close their short positions. However we learned that in 2003 the SEC and DTC made it impossible for companies to do Share Recalls of their stock, even when trying to protect themselves from naked shorting. Share Recalls are instead something that financial institutions can do, to recall shares lent to short sellers...however seemingly not an action likely to happen in the GameStop saga.\n\nOf course there is an \"alternative\" Share Recall happening, in the form of retail investors gradually DRSing their stock. This is something GameStop can encourage and report on from the side, but not something they can directly effect. However I have found evidence that companies such as GameStop are able to direct something akin to a Share Recall - a mandatory Share Surrender. This DD presents evidence and a very interesting, relatively recent precedent of a company taking such steps. If GameStop instigate such a Share Surrender in a manner similar to this precedent, my conjecture is that it could well lead to shorts being force closed very rapidly, and thus a path to MOASS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 1. A history of Superstonk's understanding of what a 'Share Recall' actually means\n\nThere has been much confusion since the inception of this sub (and its predecessors) about the subject of Share Recalls. There was a time (mid 2021) when many Apes believed it is possible for GameStop themselves to carry out a Share Recall, thereby forcing shorts to close their positions. The reason they had not done this, as the theory went at the time, was because actioning such a recall without a legitimate business reason would result in lawsuits against the company for market manipulation. However the conjecture was that GameStop was, nonetheless, putting together a business case that would allow them to carry out a Share Recall, and thereby launch MOASS.\n\nHowever, Apes then came to learn about SEC rule SR-DTC-2003-02. Coming into effect in 2003, this was a rule proposed in the aftermath of a number of companies attempting to action recalls of their shares, when they felt that Short Sellers were manipulating their stock and the DTC was not taking sufficient steps to prevent this. The rule was proposed by the DTC themselves, in effect to lock companies in as \"prisoners\" within the DTC as a depositary, preventing them from exiting. The basic argument from the DTC was that companies have no rights to decide what happens to their shares after selling them to the market. Sole ownership rights fall with whoever hodls the stock, and the issuer is therefore unable to carry out actions such as Share Recalls.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/34-47978.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/34-47978.htm)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rv4anmxymdq91.jpg?width=1767&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2a6c027b191b19878d38e88bc4f5ffd05a35f316\n\nThe understanding of what Share Recalls are in reality then moved, correctly, to their usage by financial institutions. The most prevalent use of these is when the issuer of a stock carries out a corporate action of some kind, which makes it advantageous for stock lenders (e.g. asset management firms) to recall their shares from stock borrowers such as SHFs. Thus it was conjectured that by GameStop carrying out certain corporate actions, such as a stock dividend, lenders would recall their shares and thus force SHFs to have to close their short positions, and thus launch MOASS. An example of such conjecture is below:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ttvawt/boom\\_lenders\\_must\\_call\\_back\\_their\\_lent\\_out\\_shares/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/ttvawt/boom_lenders_must_call_back_their_lent_out_shares/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hch58m15ndq91.jpg?width=1768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=533fcc7e0e64a36276b87b9ff683d1d5b0c1952a\n\nOf course what we saw happen in reality is the DTC instructing most institutions to simply carry out a standard stock split, meaning such a Share Recall had no benefit for lenders to action. I do not believe it was GameStop's intentions, with the announcement of the stock dividend, to force into being such Share Recalls. I believe they probably knew things would turn out the way they did over the last couple of months. However this whole sorry affair lends more weight to the idea that a stock issuer cannot take actions to force a Share Recall, given the DTC and nefarious actors can just circumvent these as they please.\n\nThe most recent Share Recall method widely discussed on this sub, and currently in action on a daily basis, is of course DRS. The whole idea behind DRS is that it is a gradual Share Recall of stock from the DTC's clutches, eventually resulting in the complete removal of shares to being directly owned by retail shareholders and insiders. As someone who has 90% of their 741 GME shares held safely in my ComputerShare account, I am a firm believer in this individual shareholder led-Share Recall. It may not be an instantaneous 'Silver Bullet', but at some point (74.1% of the float? 100% of the float? 50.1% of shares issued? 100% of shares issued?) it is sure to result in something...big.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/wc56mr/drs\\_is\\_the\\_share\\_recall\\_stop\\_floating\\_around\\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/wc56mr/drs_is_the_share_recall_stop_floating_around_a/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fvtc7ef9ndq91.jpg?width=1768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f4d031b506ad59d9a178972e271b0fdd3a3746e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2. TNIB and a blueprint for a fast acting Share Surrender\n\nSo the story of Share Recalls seemingly stops there, as we wait for the incremental and inevitable march towards the DRS share numbers encroaching, enveloping and eventually eviscerating those held in the DTC. The only power to effect such a Share Recall thus lies with the tens of thousands of individual shareholders, and a small number of company insiders whose shares are also held by ComputerShare. GameStop's involvement and ability to effect a Share Recall thus begins and ends with the \"encouragement\" of quarterly reporting DRS numbers, and nothing much else directly possible beyond that. Right?\n\nMaybe. Maybe not... I have come across some information that points towards them actually having a means to effect something similar to a Share Recall - a Share Surrender. The evidence I present for this is a past precedent, namely the actions taken up by a company called TNI BioTech Inc. in the period 2013-2015, which I will henceforth refer to as 'TNIB'. Credit for pointing me towards uncovering this is with u/weregoingstreaking, through some private exchanges I had with him/her. He/she was more interested in the resultant broker criminality which ensued from these eventw, however I became interested to learn what led to these issues in the first place. What jacked my tits was that the origination was TNIB ordering and then effecting a mandatory Share Surrender of their stock to their transfer agent.\n\nI believe this story may serve as a blueprint for GameStop also carrying out such an action in the future. If the mechanisms that TNIB pursued are still possible, it would therefore mean the company does also still have the power to effect a Share Surrender themselves. Consequently if my findings are correct, then it could mean that Share Recalls are possible through the actions of individual shareholders continuously DRSing their shares, but concurrently Share Surrenders are possible by GameStop carrying out similar actions to TNIB.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 3. Common stock certificates exchange in 2013\n\nThe story begins in the summer of 2013, with TNIB effecting a corporate action to resolve issues from various M&As they had carried out over the years. By then the company had shareholders still holding the paper common stock certificates of various bought-out firms - Galliano International Ltd. (CUISP: 363816109), Resorts Clubs International, Inc. (CUISPs: 761163-104 / 203 / 302), PH Environmental Inc. (CUISP: 69338E107) and the original TNI BioTech, Inc. (CUISP: 872608104). My guess is that there were enough shareholders with these paper certificates of the bought-out firms that still held records, to cause various kinds of issues. In order to resolve these problems, TNIB issued this press release detailing the corporate action:\n\n[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tni-biotech-inc-announces-mandatory-exchange-of-common-stock-certificates-cusip-number-872608104-for-new-stock-certificates-with-active-cusip-872608203-210588751.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tni-biotech-inc-announces-mandatory-exchange-of-common-stock-certificates-cusip-number-872608104-for-new-stock-certificates-with-active-cusip-872608203-210588751.html)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x40mooafndq91.jpg?width=1768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a3f02074961e05ea965580b5678d53ca40267d8\n\nThere are three interesting points for me with this corporate action:\n\n\u2022 Firstly, it is aimed only at those shareholders holding the paper common stock certificates of the bought out companies.\u00a0\n\n\u2022 Hence this by no means affected the vast majority of shareholders and shares of TNIB, which presumably were in electronic format at street name brokers and the DTC.\u00a0\n\n\u2022 However the second interesting point was that the corporate action required those holding paper shares to mandatorily surrender these certificates and receive a replacement with the new CUISP.\u00a0\n\n\u2022The third point is the method required to be used to do that, namely to send the certificates to their transfer agent, Direct Transfer LLC.\n\nThe reason this initial corporate action piqued my interest is the fact that TNIB could take an approach, as a stock issuer, that mandatorily forced shareholders to surrender their shares. At first glance this appears to be in contravention of SEC rule SR-DTC-2003-02 detailed above, which prevents issuers from carrying out actions compelling stockholders to do anything. However looking more closely at the precise wording within the rule, it prevents the withdrawal of shares by the issuing companies...but not the replacement of shares with new or updated versions of those shares. Hence TNIB's corporate action was actually keeping within the wording of the rule, although in effect being a mini-Share Recall of some of their paper stock certificates.\n\nIMG\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 4. Cytocom spin-off announcement in May 2014\n\nHaving successfully effected the above described mini-Share Recall in 2013, from what I can tell it emboldened TNIB to go one step further a year later. In May 2014, the company announced that they will carry out an internal reorganisation of their business lines, to officially spin-off one of their subsidiaries named Cytocom. Below is the press release issued by TNIB, which their board had determined would be in the best interests of thr company's shareholders:\n\n[https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/tni-biotech-announces-proposed-spin-off-of-b-cytocom-inc-b-/](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/tni-biotech-announces-proposed-spin-off-of-b-cytocom-inc-b-/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x7lkcjwindq91.jpg?width=1590&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c85ce098a882160b9a64fccb605b4e80a1f3a53e\n\nOnce again, there are some very interesting points to note with this corporate action:\n\n\u2022 To begin with, its result would be TNIB shareholders continuing to hold their shares of that company, and those equities still being publicly tradeable on the OTCQB market for mid-tier venture firms.\u00a0\n\n\u2022 However these same shareholders would also receive shares of Cytocom, which would operate as a spun-off private firm and thus with those shares not tradeable on an exchange.\n\n\u2022 Secondly, taking a cue from their corporate action the previous year, the press release announces that \"mandatory surrender of existing TNIB shares will be required to receive shares of Cytocom through the Distribution\".\n\n\u2022 So once more TNIB is effecting a corporate action that requires a mandatory action to take place\n\n\u2022 However you may have noticed that this action is to be carried out by all shareholders, not just those with paper common stock certificates, hence also including those held in electronic formats.\n\n\u2022 The third and final point to note is that, unlike the previous action, this press release does not give much detail to shareholders about how to mandatorily surrender their shares.\u00a0\n\n\u2022 There is no mention in this initial press release explaining how TNIB shareholders can go about doing that, such as contacting their transfer agent (which had changed, in fact, from Direct Transfer LLC to Guardian Register & Transfer Inc).\u00a0\n\nTNIB may have avoided providing the methodology detail because the approach they would go onto specify caused quite some commotion over that summer... Perhaps their board realised that a \"bomb dropping\" of this kind required releasing this information gradually and gently. However, as you will see in the next couple of parts of the story, what they went on to direct certainly caused some pain to brokers and no doubt SHFs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 5. A Share Recall, literally on paper!\n\nThe months following this, in the summer of 2014, seem to have been a busy one for TNIB and its various stakeholders. The detailed directive from TNIB about how shareholders must mandatorily surrender their shares, in order to receive the dividend distribution of their spin-off Cytocom's private stock, seems to have caused quite some commotion. Although the original record date for the distribution was due to take place on July 15th, these difficulties resulted in TNIB issuing an extension detailed here:\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2014-08-14/tni-biotech-inc-announces-an-extension-to-the-record-date-of-its-wholly-owned-subsidiary-cytocom-inc-and-dividend-now-set](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2014-08-14/tni-biotech-inc-announces-an-extension-to-the-record-date-of-its-wholly-owned-subsidiary-cytocom-inc-and-dividend-now-set)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ujzx0zamndq91.jpg?width=1768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0ae69778f2168927472c235a9f8733c196b5b4c\n\nA summary of notable points from this announcement is as follows:\n\n\u2022 TNIB made the stock surrender a mandatory requirement for ALL shares, but they also specified that the surrender must be carried out in paper share certificate format.\n\n\u2022 Therefore they effectively turned off the button for making standard electronic transfers, and only permitted shareholders to send in the physical paper certificates to their transfer agent.\n\n\u2022 This meant that shareholders who did not have their shares in paper format, which would of course have meant the vast majority of them, first had to obtain or convert the digital record of their TNIB shares to the transfer agent.\n\n\u2022 The transfer agent would then provide paper share certificates for their TNIB shares, but along with that also provide paper share certificates for private spin-off Cytocom.\n\n\u2022 With the major amounts of paperwork this approach required, this was proving a difficult task for many of the shareholders and brokers to complete.\u00a0\n\n\u2022 TNIB therefore provided an extension to when this process had to be completed, extending the Record Date to receive the Cytocom stock dividend until 30th September.\n\nI do not know why TNIB decided to follow this method, which would no doubt have been extremely cumbersome for them and their transfer agent as well. However this second Share Surrender was in effect a full Share Recall of a kind, one that would allow TNIB and the transfer agent to see precisely how many shareholders they actually now had (i.e. including, potentially, those to whom the stock had been sold through naked short selling). It was also preventing the DTC and street name brokers from creating electronic IOUs instead of \"real\" shares, as the final delivery to shareholders had to be both TNIB and Cytocom paper share certificates. As detailed next, Wall Street was not prepared to do this without a fight...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 6. The Schwab e-mail and TNIB'S letter to shareholders\n\nYou Apes are going to love this next part of the story! As I said in the previous section, the process that TNIB had mandated for distributing their spin-off Cytocom's stock was causing huge headaches for the brokers. Having gotten used to creating IOUs and synthetics out of thin air since the 1970s, the manual nature that TNIB was forcing them to follow did not go down very well with them at all. In communications to TNIB shareholders, it had appeared they had been blaming TNIB for not carrying out the steps in a timely manner.\u00a0\n\nThis resulted in TNIB's CEO Noreen Griffin to publish a letter to the shareholders, one day before the 30th September Record Date for the stock dividend. Within the letter, Ms. Griffin defends and justifies the approach her company had taken, and dismisses broker claims and requests for a more \"standard\" process to be followed. However the best part is a (highly doxxing!) sharing of a complaint from one of the brokers, Schwab. If you read nothing else line-by-line within this DD, I would urge you to read the panicked, mansplaining, condescension of that e-mail from the Schwab representative to TNIB's Investor Relations manager:\n\n[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tni-biotech-inc-corporations-ceo-issues-letter-to-shareholders-discussing-cytocom-dividend-277484861.html#financial-modal](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tni-biotech-inc-corporations-ceo-issues-letter-to-shareholders-discussing-cytocom-dividend-277484861.html#financial-modal)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l8j206wqndq91.jpg?width=1768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96a71378e45bdd42f909b05cf729e34cb7870f08\n\nA summary of Ms. Griffin's letter to the shareholders follows:\n\n\u2022 She acknowledges that TNIB had by then already streamlined the process significantly, by permitting the DTC's Deposit and Withdrawal at Custodian (\"DWAC\") service using a Fast Automated Securities Transfer Service (\"FAST\").\n\n\u2022 This is a method of shares direct registration, which is similar to DRS but where it is still held by the DTC - more details available here:\u00a0\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dwac.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dwac.asp)\n\n\u2022 TNIB allowed this concession from their original stipulation, so that \"DTCC Participants \\[brokerage firms\\]\" did not have to carry out \"physical surrender in client name \\[and instead\\] providing Guardian Transfer a list of our beneficial holders along with share amounts, address & TINs\".\n\n\u2022 However she completely dismisses the Schwab representative's request to switch further to the \"standard\" method used these days for such stock dividend issuances, and reiterates that the mandatory surrender of shares is still necessary\n\n\u2022 She goes on to highlight the ludicrousness of Schwab's claims, in which they appear to cast blame on TNIB for being unable to recall shares swiftly enough from those that had borrowed the stock i.e. most likely SHFs\n\n\u2022 The letter concluded with a doubling down of TNIB's stance, which is that brokers had been given ample time - 90 days - for shares to be recalled from short sellers and surrendered to the transfer agent\n\nHowever even more than Ms. Griffin's letter, it is the Schwab representative's e-mail which is quite astonishing to me in its brevity. He appears to openly admit that Schwab, and the entire Wall Street brokerage establishment, partakes in the worst excesses outed by members of this sub over the last couple of years as a normal course of their business operations. In fact, there is a particular passage within his e-mail which is basically describing FTDs caused by multiple rehypothecations of the same original share i.e. illegal naked short selling:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v00gnvrtndq91.jpg?width=1768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d8e1c9638c481a985912589e6272148e7bc7da5\n\nI do not think the Schwab representative thought his e-mail would see the light of day, and it appears to me like a last ditch 'Hail Mary' play with time running out. He therefore probably tried to just say to TNIB that this is how the industry operates and that the company has to get with it...but had his bluff called by TNIB. CEO Griffin went so far as to doxx and then point-by-point dismiss and highlight the absurdness of Schwab trying to normalise FTDs, which was no doubt a humiliating final message to Wall Street from TNIB: \"We are doing this our way, whatever you guys might say to try and pressurise us\". What a champion!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 7. Aftermath of the Share Surrender and dividend stock distribution\u00a0\n\n\u2022 The period between the announcement of the Cytocom spin-off stock dividend distribution and its eventual completion saw some extraordinary movement in the share price of TNIB stock.\n\n\u2022 That time span was five months and the volatility of the share price indicates there may have been closing, re-shorting and closing again of short positions.\n\n\u2022 For example, the share price fell to an intra-day low of $162.90 on 11th July, however then increased rapidly to $435.00 only two trading days later on 15th July (+167%).\n\n\u2022 In fact, it appears there may have been four or five seperate Gamma Squeezes and Short Squeezes during the period before the Cytocom stock dividend spin out distribution.\n\n\u2022 It seems likely the mandatory surrender of shares necessitated by TNIB's corporate action was responsible for this painful episode for short sellers and their enabling brokers.\n\n\u2022 Having successfully completed the Cytocom spin-out on 1st October 2014, Ms. Griffin stepped down as CEO and Chairman of TNIB and retired for a few years.\n\n\u2022 However according to her LinkedIn profile ([https://www.linkedin.com/in/noreen-griffin-74893b37](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noreen-griffin-74893b37)) she now appears to be back as an Executive VP at Cytocom, the company she helped launch in that summer of 2014.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 8. A possible blueprint for GameStop Corp.?\n\nAs far as I can tell, TNIB's mandatory Stock Surrender corporate action is an approach that other companies are potentially also able to effect, as it falls within SEC's rule SR-DTC-2003-02. For firms that have likely had excessive naked short selling of their stock, such as GameStop, it appears to be a way to effect mandatory closing of short positions. By doing so, companies such as these may be able to create scenarios whereby accurate price discovery for their stock is made possible once more. As this is a fiduciary duty for the board of any publicly listed firm, such Stock Surrenders may thus be a method to create shareholder value.\n\nSome specific points in the case of GameStop carrying out such a corporate action:\n\n\u2022 The legitimacy of such an action is dependent on it not affecting market manipulation, but instead having a sound business case.\n\n\u2022 In TNIB's case this was in order to consolidate paper stock certificates under a single CUISP (in 2013) and to distribute a share dividend of a private spin-off company (in 2014).\n\n\u2022 As an example, GameStop could legitimately spin-off its NFT division and Marketplace as a seperate entity from the bricks-and-mortar retail chain (GMErica, anyone?)\n\n\u2022 To do so, they may be able to replicate TNIB's approach of requiring a mandatory Share Surrender, in order to receive the stock dividend of the new spin-off company.\n\n\u2022 The whole point of such a Share Surrender is to force all those who hold the stock to \"return\" shares to the company's transfer agent, so that they can issue the stock dividend directly to share holders.\n\n\u2022 This is in conrast to GameStop's stock split in the form of a stock dividend carried out in July, which was to distribute the additional shares not just directly through ComputerShare, but also through intermediaries such as the DTC and their member brokerage firms.\n\n\u2022 The 'genius' of the approach TNIB took was that they made it a mandatory requirement that all shares had to first be returned to their transfer agent in order to receive the stock dividend, including by forcing brokerage firms to send a full list of all their TNIB shareholders and share numbers.\n\n\u2022 GameStop carrying out this same approach would most likely result in the DTC and brokers having a \"Schwab moment\", when realising that providing their actual list would mean providing comprehensive proof of them illegally over-selling shares without locates.\n\n\u2022 Hence in order to reconcile their shareholders lists to match how many are on record at the DTC, which theoretically should not include sales of IOUs/synthetics, my conjecture is that brokers with stock lending programs would have no choice but to recall shares lent to short sellers.\n\n\u2022 However with the free float having shrunk to almost nothing through DRS, and all the stock lending brokers forced to act en masse to recall shares to fulfill the mandatory Share Surrender, there will be no possibility to cover these by borrowing new shares from other lending institutions (as there will no longer be anyone prepared to or even able to lend the stock).\n\n\u2022 Hence my conjecture is that the various parties on the wrong side of all this - prime brokers, stock lending asset managers, retail brokerage firms, and of course Short Hedge Funds - will suddenly have to go from their current stance of co-operating with each other to keep MOASS at bay, to instead be fighting each other tooth-and-nail in order to carry out the Share Surrender.\n\n\u2022 With the currently available option of using new borrows to settle old ones no longer an option, the only remaining approach will then become purchasing (or, at least, trying to purchase) shares in the open market.\n\n\u2022 Perhaps after burning through a few shares sold by early paperhands, it will become increasingly difficult to carry out such purchases at reasonable prices, resulting in the asking prices to rise astronomically as SHFs attempt to close out likely hundreds of millions of short positions.\n\n\u2022 The result of such a Share Surrender corporate action by GameStop could very well be as prophesied on this and predecessor subs from 84 years ago: the Mother Of All Short Squeezes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 9. A possible blueprint for $GME's majority owners - soon to be Insiders and DRSed Retail Investors?\n\nWhat I described in the previous section is currently a fantasy - there is nothing to say that GameStop would effect such a Share Surrender any time in the near future. Although it seems to me this is an approach they could legitimately and legally take, I have not been able to uncover a shred of evidence pointing to them actually planning such an approach. Maybe this is what the board has had in the works for the last couple of years...but maybe it's just my hopium.\n\nHowever our shareholder rights provides each of us with a number of benefits and privileges. Specifically these are: voting power, ownership, the right to transfer ownership, dividends, the right to inspect corporate documents, the right to sue for wrongful acts, and the right to advocate Shareholder Proposals. Some of you may remember a two-part DD that I published less than a month ago about the last of these rights - Shareholder Proposals using SEC Rule 14a-8:\n\nPart 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x29utb/how\\_rule\\_14a8\\_and\\_drsing\\_more\\_than\\_50\\_of\\_shares/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x29utb/how_rule_14a8_and_drsing_more_than_50_of_shares/)\n\nPart 2: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x29ull/how\\_rule\\_14a8\\_and\\_drsing\\_more\\_than\\_50\\_of\\_shares/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/x29ull/how_rule_14a8_and_drsing_more_than_50_of_shares/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wd8h5fgzndq91.jpg?width=1590&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6027a1176f4616c053c5b20c972018bcaf118c70\n\nThis DD was controversial, in that it details a method whereby individual shareholders could take steps to compel GameStop to effect a corporate action. I recognise that DD had a somewhat polarising reception, but I merely wanted to highlight that there are things that each of us has, as individual shareholders who bought $GME shares, have rights to. u/luckeeelooo makes this case with the below follow-up comment about that DD, in response to concerns raised by some other sub users (to Mods) about it:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r2otiph4odq91.jpg?width=1623&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=02e80ae6bd3386162acb2d8682d83ee89cc1be62\n\nThe reason I bring up that DD is because a Share Surrender is an example of a corporate action that an individual investor can raise as a Shareholder Proposal. Hence even if GameStop's board is not currently planning to take such an approach, this is nonetheless an method they could be compelled to follow. That is, if an individual shareholder makes such a Shareholder Proposal, and a majority of the overall shareholder body votes positively in support of it.\u00a0\n\nNote that this is not something I am necessarily advocating, as a \"call to arms\". However for any SHF shills reading this, I hope you take this message back to your masters: there are multiple approaches in addition to DRS that both GameStop and individual investors can employ, in order to force close short positions. So before someone, somewhere enacts a Share Surrender, do the sensible thing and exit your lost bet. The first Hedgies to close out might still survive, while the rest of the slower Hedgies...r fuk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 10. Summary\n\n\u2022 Superstonk went through several iterations of its understanding of what a Share Recall actually is,\n\n\u2022 At first it was thought this is something that GameStop can themselves instigate, in order to force Short Sellers to close their positions.\n\n\u2022 However it was learned that the DTC, working in cahoots with the SEC, has blocked such a path by companies since 2003.\n\n\u2022 The common usage of the term Share Recalls, it was found, is the act by stock lenders to recall shares from borrowers, typically Short Sellers.\n\n\u2022 Although corporate actions such as stock dividends can produce such Share Recalls, it appears these can be circumvented through the DTC and brokers simply not carrying out corporate actions in the manner directed by issuing companies.\n\n\u2022 Finally, it has since been realised that retail investors DRSing their holdings is, in fact, a gradual form of Share Recall which may take a while, but highly likely to result in SHFs having to eventually close their positions.\n\n\u2022 However I found evidence and a precedent for a corporate action that GameStop can themselves action, which may also force SHFs to close their positions much faster.\n\n\u2022 This is something called a Share Surrender, which a company called TNI BioTech (then with the ticker TNIB, and now IMUN) successfully effected twice, in 2013 and 2014.\n\n\u2022 A Share Surrender appears to be within the SEC's regulations and comply also with the DTC's internal rules, as this is not an act of a stock issuing company attempting to withdraw its shares being held by the DTC.\n\n\u2022 Instead it is a corporate action to reset or consolidate its stock, rather than to withdraw from the DTC altogether, and thus not a withdrawal request to the DTC.\n\n\u2022 The first instance that TNIB took of this approach was in 2013, in order to make defunct the paper stock certificates of subsidiaries it had bought out over the years.\n\n\u2022 The DTC permitted TNIB to make a mandatory call for Share Surrenders of these paper certificates, to be exchanged for new certificates under a single CUISP number.\n\n\u2022 Having being emboldened by the success of this initial, limited scale Share Surrender in 2013, TNIB went onto enact a much wider reaching directive not long after.\n\n\u2022 In 2014 they decided to spin out a subsidiary named Cytocom as a private firm, with the distribution of this new entity's shares being distributed through a stock dividend.\n\n\u2022 However TNIB required a mandatory Share Surrender of TNIB stock, in paper certificate format, in order to receive the new Cytocom stock.\n\n\u2022 Effectively this was thus also a full Share Recall, as all TNIB shared had to be returned to the transfer agent in paper certificate format, to receive paper certificates of the new Cytocom shares.\n\n\u2022 The effect was consternation and panic by Wall Street brokers, and no doubt SHFs to whom they had lent shares, when trying to carry out this mandatorily Share Surrender.\n\n\u2022 TNIB eventually agreed to an extension to the deadline for carrying this out, and also permitted a DTC-internalised version of DRS, but which would still mandatorily require brokers to provide a full and comprehensive list of all theit TNIB shareholders.\n\n\u2022 TNIB's CEO was forced to write a public letter to shareholders, defending their stance and even sharing an extraordinary e-mail received from Schwab, in which they tried to normalise naked short selling and FTDs as a reason to revert to a \"normal\" dividend stock distribution.\n\n\u2022 With no option but to fulfil the mandatory Share Surrender, it appears brokers had no choice but to carry out Share Recalls from SHFs they had lent the stock to.\n\n\u2022 The result seems to be a series of Gamma Squeezes and Short Squeezes during the summer of 2014, including some extraordinary price action e.g. +167% in 2 days.\n\n\u2022 My conjecture is that if the mechanism used by TNIB to force a Share Surrender is still possible, it could be one employed by GameStop's board, to help fulfill their fiduciary duty of promoting accurate price discovery of $GME stock.\n\n\u2022 There may be multiple legitimate business cases for which they could apply a Stock Surrender, however the one I provided as an example is in order to spin-off a subsidiary named GMErica (e.g. as a seperate entity for their NFT division and Marketplace).\n\n\u2022 In any case, a Share Surrender appears to be a mechanism for GameStop themselves to instigate (effectively) a very fast acting Share Recall, to complement the more gradual Share Recall of individual retail shareholders DRSing.\n\n\u2022 As I have also highlighted with one of my previous DDs, regarding SEC Rule 14a-8, such a Share Surrender may even be within the power of a single Ape to make a Shareholder Proposal for at some point.",

        "Title": "[OC] we always ask \"what lineup would you use to beat the aliens?\" but we never ask \"WHICH aliens?\" And with that in mind, I present the proper alien-fighting lineup for all scenarios",
        "Body/Content": "During the offseason, we tend to float silly hypotheticals around here. One of the most common for redditors and real writers like Bill Simmons alike is: \"What lineup would you use to beat the aliens?\" Essentially, we're trying to suggest the BEST LINEUP on Earth, using the conceit of an alien invasion as a mere prop for that discussion.\n\nBut [aliens](\nhttp://this1that1whatever.com/miscellany/Alien-Abduction-Brain-Teaser.php) deserve more respect than that. We can't just lump \"aliens\" all together, because no two alien invaders are exactly alike. So rather than suggest a lineup against \"the aliens,\" I'm going to suggest specific lineups against 10 specific alien species. \n\nSo welcome, my friends and fellow bored fans, to -- \n\n######**THE GALAXY CUP**\n\n**LITTLE GREEN MEN ALIENS**\n\nPG:\t Russell Westbrook (HOU)\n\nSG:\t Jimmy Butler (MIA)\n\nSF:  Aaron Gordon (ORL)\n\nPF:\tZion Williamson (NO)\n\nC:  Joel Embiid (PHI)\n\n*the game plan*\n\nWe start the tournament against our traditional rival, the classic \"Little Green Men\" (of Area 51 and Roswell fame.) And since these are *little* green men,  our intention is to beat them with a big lineup and a \"bully ball\" approach. Spacing? Who needs spacing? Our plan is to live in the paint and dominate on the glass. We want a blowout victory to set the tone for the rest of the tournament, with some Zion Williamson dunking and some Joel Embiid cackling to hammer the point home.\n\n**E.T. ALIENS**\n\nPG:\t Mike Conley (UTA)\n\nSG:\t J.J. Redick (NO)\n\nSF:  Andre Iguodala (MEM)\n\nPF:  Kevin Love (CLE)\n\nC:  Al Horford (PHI)\n\n*the game plan*\n\nWhile we wanted to humiliate the Little Green Men, we don't have the same type of animosity against the lovable aliens from E.T.'s planet. In fact, we want as respectful and diplomatic of a lineup as possible. Mike Conley would set the friendly tone with his tech-free approach, while media darlings J.J. Redick, Andre Iguodala, and Kevin Love could handle the clean communication. Even our center Al Horford will refuse to take advantage and pad his stats.\n\n**INDEPENDENCE DAY ALIENS**\n\nPG:\t Ben Simmons (PHI)\n\nSG:\t Manu Ginobili (SA)\n\nSF:  Robert Covington (MIN)\n\nPF:  Pascal Siakam (TOR)\n\nC:  Rudy Gobert (UTA)\n\n*the game plan*\n\nThe cold-hearted Independence Day aliens (similar to War of the World aliens) are our toughest opponent yet. They're not here to mess around -- they want to come down, fuck shit up, and conquer. Their patented style of play is an aggressive offense that will attack at a moment's notice. Given that, building a strong defensive wall will be critical for us. Like a young Will Smith, Ben Simmons be the rising superstar to lead our team into battle, drawing in an alliance from all over the world (with 5 separate continents represented in the lineup.) Is it a mistake to give the over-the-hill Manu Ginobili one of those spots? Maybe. But you can't beat these Harvesters with brawn alone; the crafty Ginobili can be our Jeff Goldblum and figure out the hole in the aliens' defense.\n\n**INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS ALIENS**\n\nPG:\t J.J. Barea (DAL)\n\nSG:\t Isaiah Thomas (WAS)\n\nSF:\tJoe Ingles (UTA)\n\nPF:\tNemanja Bjelica (SAC)\n\nC:  Nikola Jokic (DEN)\n\n*the game plan*\n\nOnce again, we have to utilize our craftiness to beat an opponent. The Invasion of the Body Snatchers would surely try to swap some bodies, so we will give them the worst \"bodies\" we can find. Either limited by height (J.J. Barea and I.T.), or athleticism (like Nikola Jokic), the Body Snatchers would be befuddled by their physical limitations. Meanwhile, our high-IQ and highly-skilled players could still thrive no matter what physical vessel they may inhabit.\n\n**STRANGER THINGS ALIENS**\n\nPG:\t De'Aaron Fox (SAC)\n\nSG:\t Luka Doncic (DAL)\n\nSF:\tJayson Tatum (BOS)\n\nPF:\tJaren Jackson Jr. (MEM)\n\nC:\tDraymond Green (GS)\n\n*the game plan*\n\nThe Demogorgon from Strangers Things isn't necessarily an alien from outer space, but it comes from a different plane in the Upside-Down and is hence an \"alien\" to our world. And while it's quite dangerous (kinda?), these monsters clearly have trouble keeping up with young legs. To that end, we wanted a youthful team featuring players like Jayson Tatum and Jaren Jackson Jr. Meanwhile, Slovenian wunderkind Luka Doncic has the \"Eleven\"-like magic touch, while Draymond Green will fulfill our Hopper role of being the veteran puncher/kicker who will get wildly angry from time to time for no apparent reason.\n\n**DISTRICT 9 ALIENS**\n\nPG:  Lonzo Ball (NO)\n\nSG:  Markelle Fultz (ORL)\n\nSF:  Andre Roberson (OKC)\n\nPF:  Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (CHA)\n\nC:  Bismack Biyombo (CHA) \n\n*the game plan*\n\n(Spoiler alert!) but the \"prawns\" from District 9 turn out to be far less aggressive and threatening than their appearance may lead you to believe. Sure, we need a sensible and respectful defense, but we don't need to aggravate tension. Our instructions to our team are clear: \"don't shoot!\" As long as we keep a roster of reluctant shooters in tow, the prawns should ultimately realize that their hearts are not in this tournament and start their retreat.\n\n**PACIFIC RIM ALIENS**\n\nPG:  Matthew Dellavedova (CLE)\n\nSG:  James Harden (HOU)\n\nSF:  Rui Hachimura (WAS)\n\nPF:  Yi Jianlian (CHINA)\n\nC:  Steven Adams (OKC)\n\n*the game plan*\n\nAs we get deeper into the tournament, the level of competition steps up a few notches. Combating the alien monsters from Pacific Rim represents a tall task: literally. We're talking about kaiju who may run over 300 feet. You're not going to overwhelm this team physically, so we need intangibles. We need soldiers who are going to display teamwork, grit, and the determination to protect their Pacific Ocean home turf. How are we actually going to *win*, though? How will this particular team score? Good question. James Harden will have to do the lion's share of the work by drawing and exaggerating contact (which should be frequent.) And for all we criticize Harden, he is the rare player with Jaeger-like body armor to take those hits and keep on chugging. If we can get him 40+ free throws, this game may be winnable after all.\n\n**XENOMORPH ALIENS (from the Aliens franchise)**\n\nPG:  Marcus Smart (BOS)\n\nSG:  Elena Delle Donne (WAS)\n\nSF:  Kawhi Leonard (LAC)\n\nPF:  James Johnson (MIA)\n\nC:  Marshall Plumlee (USA)\n\n*the game plan*\n\nOn paper, the xenomorphs appear to be one of the fiercest and scariest matchups in the field. Fortunately, there's been a clear template to combat them. You start with a group of tough and rugged soldiers \u2013 Marcus Smart, James Johnson, and Marshall Plumlee (who had literally signed up for the Marine Corps already) \u2013 and add one wildcard cyborg to the mix (in Kawhi Leonard.) And of course, the key is anchoring the lineup with a strong female leader like Elena Delle Donne. In fact, she may be an even deadlier shot than Ripley. This past season for the Mystics, Delle Donne registered a 50/40/90 season, including 97% from the free throw line.\n\n**PREDATOR ALIENS**\n\nPG:  Stephen Curry (GS)\n\nSG:\t Klay Thompson (GS)\n\nSF:\tPaul George (LAC)\n\nPF:\tGiannis Antetokounmpo (MIL)\n\nC:  Karl-Anthony Towns (MIN)\n\n*the game plan*\n\nOne of the most difficult opponents in the field and a betting favorite in Vegas, the Predators are going to be tough to beat. Not only are they fierce and ruthless killers who hunt for sport, they also possess superior intelligence, advanced technology/analytics, and unlike some others in the field: opposable thumbs. So how in the world can we beat a team like that? More wily tricks, of course. The Predators have heat vision, so our approach will be to surround the perimeter with great shooters who can get red \"hot,\" draw the defense out, and allow the Greek Freak Giannis to sneak in and deliver the knockout blow.\n\n**KRYPTONIAN ALIENS (a la Superman)**\n\nPG:  Damian Lillard (POR)\n\nSG:  Bradley Beal (WAS)\n\nSF:  Kevin Durant (BKN)\n\nPF:  LeBron James (LAL)\n\nC:  Anthony Davis (LAL)\n\n*the game plan*\n\nYes, Superman is an alien, despite all appearances -- so maybe you should take a step back and consider your own biases regarding space lifeforms, huh. In fact, our intergalactic television partners are hyping up this contest as the marquee matchup in the entire field. They're blasting thousands of comet and asteroid advertisements across space with a simple marketing pitch: LeBron James vs. Superman!!\n\nDoes LeBron James have a chance in that individual matchup? Of course not, you silly goose. LeBron is a great basketball player, but Superman is a virtual god. He has superhuman strength, X-ray vision, ice cold breath, and the literal ability to fly. In some ways, he is SO powerful and invulnerable that he's actually a little boring of a character.\n\nAnd therein lies our secret strategy. We'll sic LeBron's BFF Rich Paul (our Lex Luthor evil genius) to spread that message around the star system. Superman is boring. He's old news. His \"Superman\" franchise been stalling out. Meanwhile, the popularity of LeBron James and the NBA continues to soar. That's where the money is! Paul needs to convince the league, the refs, and those TV partners of ours to give Team Earth a little edge and some favorable calls. Because if we can rattle the Kryptonians early on, they're likely to start turning on each other and self-destructing. Just ask Jor-El.",

And walked into the living room.\n\n\u201cPOLICE CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR THE BATON ROUGE SERIAL KILLER\u2026\u201d\n\nIt was then and there that I got the feeling that I might have fucked up.\n\nTo make matters worse, I had previously attracted my very own insane stalker, who went by the name ICEKNIFE. The fact that I ran the hipster site\u00a0Reptilian Watch\u00a0didn\u2019t help. Plus, I was in a somewhat edgy death metal band of some slight underground renown,\u00a0Gortician.\n\nHere\u2019s a fun death threat letter I got from ICEKNIFE in the mail:\n\n\u00a0(See link below)\n\nAnyway, as obsessive stalkers do, this dude was all over the CourtTV message boards, local news sites, Usenet, telling everyone who would listen that he had figured out who the Baton Rouge Serial Killer was, and throwing my name around every chance he got. Which was considerable.\n\nI should mention that a girl had gotten her head almost completely cut off at UL before I left Lafayette a few years previously, and a female professor from Tech went missing shortly after I arrived in Ruston. Unfortunate coincidences, I assure you.\n\nA month or two of this, and I got a call from the Monroe FBI field office.\n\n\u201cMr. Christie, we have received 14,000 tips, and 15 were about you. We\u2019d like to come and test your DNA.\u201d\n\nI explained the situation and said, \"Sure\".\n\nThe local field agent was a good ole\u2019 boy, and we had a bit of a laugh at the circumstances. He was accompanied by a D.C. profiler. She was literally Skully. Tall, beautiful, redhead. And she was good at it. As he and I spoke outside, we moved around, slightly. She was always just outside of my field of vision. Like a ninja detective.\n\nEventually I spit in a cup, and that was the end of it. No, I wasn\u2019t the Baton Rouge Serial Killer.\n\nA few months later, I got another call from the same Monroe field agent.\n\n\u201cMr. Christie, we meet again. I understand you work for Lt. Matthew Stroud. Would you be interested in giving grand jury testimony\u2026?\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s a story for another day.\n\n\n\nTldr: I accidentally trolled so hard I became a suspected serial killer and got a visit from the FBI for DNA.\n\n\n\n[Article with Links, Image](https://jasonzchristie.blogspot.com/2021/05/trolling-my-way-into-fbi-swab.html?m=1)",
